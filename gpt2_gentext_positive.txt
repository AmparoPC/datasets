 "I recently had the opportunity to stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park and had a great stay. The hotel is small but cozy. The service is top notch. I felt as if I was a celebrity guest at this hotel. The room was on the 3rd level and the beds were extremely comfortable. The view from my room was amazing and not a bit away from the hotel. The prices were very reasonable for what I paid. I would stay there again the next time I visit Chicago.
" 
====================
 "I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel, and it was the best choice my husband and I ever had! From the look of the hotel, it certainly looks like a modern day Hyatt. Not old-worldy like many hotels I have stayed at, it is spacious and comfortable. It is clean, modern, and has a classy decor that I have only come to appreciate while staying in Chicago. The rooms are clean and spacious, and the bed is absolutely comfortable! I have never had a bad stay at this hotel, and I am looking forward to coming back as I book online now. 
" 
====================
 "My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago last week and will most definitly stay here again! Its a beautiful hotel with many amenities. The people are incredible and the rooms are quiet! Everyie is nice and helpful. The rooms are quiet, immaculate and the staff is courteous. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely return! 
" 
====================
 "My wife and I stayed here at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago last year and I felt lucky to get a room here. The location couldn't be beat, distance from the city was perfect and the staff was very friendly and polite. We got a room with a king size bed that was very comfortable and had everything you could need when in town. The bathroom was a nice size with a nice water based shower stall. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the Chicago area.
" 
====================
 "My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming. When we arrived at the pool area the water was covered by a white scum. I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool, one white phone and one white phone, to call the desk. Both were out of service!!!! I am glad there wasn't an emergency. As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean.... never heard back. One more thing, in our room the furniture was mostly child friendly except for a large metal and glass outdated coffee table. Within 30 minutes my 5 year old fell and hit her mouth and began bleeding. They need to update this piece of furniture.
" 
====================
 "I recently stayed at this hotel with my family (10-1 / 10-3). We had a terrific experience. I landed the hotel through Priceline for $80 per night and paid an additional $75 per night for a suite on the 41st floor. My two young boys loved it as the view was unbelieveable and the pool on the 42nd floor was easily accessible. I found all the employees that we interfaced with to be very friendly and accommodating. I will return to the Hyatt anytime! 
" 
====================
 "If you are looking for a small boutique hotel in downtown Chicago and you are located in a tough market, the Talbott is the place for you. From the moment you walk into the room, you are greeted with respect and confidence. The staff is multilingual and always smiling, and the accommodations are the nicest I have ever seen online. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.
" 
====================
 "From the moment I stepped up to the front we were impeccably treated. When I arrived at the hotel I was met with friendly service that was more than helpful. The room was gorgeous. The decor was modern and sleek. The bathroom was breathtaking. Every whimumers suggestion and gesture was impeccable. My favorite part was the fabulous bathroom--were you want to relax and unwind with a comfortable bed...the Hyatt Regency Chicago is your ticket. I were treated like a king...and loved!
" 
====================
 "I went to the Homewood Suites in Chicago last month and I must say I was very impressed with the service and the boutique in the Chicago area. The rooms were very clean and the staff was very friendly. I felt like a queen right from the check in to the check out. The bathrooms were very nice as well. The prices were very reasonable for the superb location and the amenities. My favorite part was the wonderful welcome everyone gave! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great establishment to stay in while visiting Chicago!
" 
====================
 "I loved this hotel and would definitely stay here again! Has a very eclectic clientele. Very friendly service. Great location too! Great food and wine at LaQuinta! Overall, a great experience!
" 
====================
 "I stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel for a weekend while visiting a friend in Chicago. The hotel is very elegant and luxurious. The atmosphere was very nice and friendly. The staff was very helpful and the room was very clean. I will definitely try this hotel again. 
" 
====================
 "We stayed here because of all the great reviews, and it's actually pretty good. The food was pretty good as well, for a 29-unit hotel. The customer service was also really good. I felt like a celebrity from when I was tiny! I was in a hurry in my little white van with the others and it only took a few taps of water to get me in! I love being able to go grab a drink after a long day of sight-seeing! I'll definitely be staying here again! 
" 
====================
 "My stay at the Ambassador East was a wonderful experience. The hotel is in an excellent location in the best of locations. It is a great value. Walking distance to everything we were wanting. The service was top notch. The room was very spacious and fresh. We got a great rate with a second room that was very attractive. It has a great view of the Hancock tower. We will stay here again and recommend the Ambassador East to others. 
" 
====================
 "The Conrad Chicago is a great hotel. My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights while visiting her-her for the first time. We are very modern and do not feel like we are 'too big to fit in' feeling a comfortable home. The service at the Conrad Chicago was fantastic, the room was clean, comfortable and was priced in a good range. We would definitely stay here again! 
" 
====================
 "I was very happy with my stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel. It is a business hotel certainly and the high price for a hotel like this one is in no way comfort to me. Upon my arrival, I was greeted by a friendly face. I checked in with no problem and was given a couple of friendly door helpings. I was given a nice room with great views of the lake and I've come to love being able to go to the beach and the Navy Pier. And the rooms are absolutely exquisite. Best of all, the Omni is conveniently located near the Navy Pier and Navy Parks. I really couldn't have asked for a better Omni. I would recommend the Omni Chicago Hotel to anyone who is looking to travel to Chicago.
" 
====================
 "The hotel is beautiful. It is an excellent location. The customer service was wonderful. I felt like a princess. The room was very clean, the beds were so comfortable, and there was a wardrobe in the closet for extra items. I felt like a queen. I ate at the restaurant dinner olympic innandur. I have stayed in many a hotel these days and this was my favorite restaurant. They offer unbeatable prices ! The food was just as amazing. The service was great and the staff was very friendly. This hotel is the perfect place to take home a gold. 
" 
====================
 "Review's a little late, but... My husband & I first stayed at the Allegro in June, '05. I was very excited since it was kind of a boy's club location, but our excitement soon turned to disappointment when we were transferred to the EL. Terrible seats, terrible lighting, and the 'L'--like the '-- was nowhere to be found. By the time we got to the room, it was July gone by then! There was no key card for our car, so we had to drive 160 + miles to get there (we took the money we could out of our account before the event). When we got to the hotel, the parking service was terrible and was terrible enough to make us miss the party. NO EXTRAONS I know this is a super small hotel, but when you're traveling with a child in tow you tend to be more hesitant about putting your stuff in places where it won't be found. This was particularly disappointing as we were looking for an easy place to sleep that didn't have pajamas. We could have stayed up and spent our break away time somewhere else.
" 
====================
 "My visit to the Conrad Chicago was a pleasure from the moment I stepped foot on the red carpet. The front desk clerks were polite and helpfull, the chocolates included were so much fun, I honestly felt like I was on a family vacation. The place was cozy and elegantly dressed to impress, especially when I had my own money! The food was to die for, very much considered but definitely considered here. I also really enjoyed the staff's work. As I dipped into the night sky, I envisioned a group of four of me taking a bath in a sexy sundecke. The masseuse was friendly as can be tell you, he brought me a massage for my hard cock, and I was even able to take a picture with him with my laptop up... even post-apocalyptic! I was new to the hotel, but felt like a celebrity after my experience. I'll definitely be staying here again on my next trip out. 
" 
====================
 "I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago and found it to be a fantastic hotel. Staff was always friendly and helpful - from the front desk clerk to the concierge. My stay was very welcoming and accomodating. My room was nicely decorated, and the beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was quite large and had a nice water feature. I was able to use the in-room coffee service and the in-room massage service. I was very impressed by the food. It was tasty! My last update was on my stay the next day, and I could not believe it! The staff is always friendly and helpful! 
" 
====================
 "I recently stayed at the Intercontinental Hotel in Chicago, and I had one of the BEST BOOKING PLAZALS online yet. The hotel really went above and beyond the normal. When I arrived, I was greeted by very friendly AND BEAUTIFUL staff. They were very helpful with the relaxing part of the vacation, which seemed to include a massage. After a luxurious room with European flare, I was shown to my room so I could try the food provided by the restaurant. I also enjoyed the in-room spa service, which was just as amazing. I was given a long-lasting, luxurious massage. While I did not partake of the standard spa treatments, I'm sure you will too. The staff was just as friendly and helpful. Finally, after a relaxing day of sightseeing, I was offered a complimentary breakfast at the hotel. The perfect time to reflect and unwind after a relaxing day of sightseeing! The staff were so friendly and helpful, that I now take them on business trips and provide them with my maps for all my shopping needs. I love their customer service. I will so time their deals well. 
" 
====================
 "My son & I joined my husband on a work trip,and we'd just been laid off from the initial call. I suggested they had a rewards program & we went ahead and got the full price. They'd refunded our entire check-in price! (We've since paid only $5.) We brought our 7-month-old up in a row,and he was eager to be brought up. As the desk assistant was telling him 'Hello, my name is Paul, and I'm a rewards attendie who reviewed the entire staff when we were checkingin for the rooms.' (here's the full exchange at the end of the post). 'He actually got me the full price of the rooms!!',(p.s. the hotel is located in downtown, hometown Chicago, inside the hotel, not k-street.)')So we hitchhiked our car to the hotel,took it downstairs to the lobby,took a breakfice back downstairs and had a great dinner THERE,took a nap there there there there THERE there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there there o/o ) Finallybus was so loud THATS INSIDE the hotel,took off,quit,took up someplace else,tended the damn thing,checked in,checked out,WOW!!!allabba know where they parking is,there are somewalks across the street,there is a Dunkin Donuts right outside the door,there is a Dunkin Bar within walking distance,there are somewalks across the street,there are some laundromats and so on...all for $7 each way...if you check in you are paying $7 for parking...I would put the cost of the rooms at $50 plus tax...if you want a Holiday Inn,you pay $7...I would put the prices at $30~40 plus tax...if you want a Holiday Inn,you pay 40~54...I would put the prices at $50~55...I would put the prices at $55~60...I would put the prices around the corner for the rest of my stay in Chicago stay...I would call $ists and got about $200...Answered? YES! I've stayed at many hotels from Mon-Fri and they all had similar prices,got the job done....
" 
====================
 "We stayed at the Talbott for 5 nights through a self-goalset hotel. The reviews were mixed as of of this writing. However, we stayed there because of its web site and basically every hotel in the Chicago area offers a similar experience. There is no way that we will ever stay at the Talbott again. Neither do I recommend it to anyone and there are many places to stay in the Chicago area. I give you, business or pleasure, to save yourself the trouble. 
" 
====================
 "I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers with my husband for a weekend and we were totally impressed. The entire staff was extremely helpful and felt was right off to do with us. The rooms were extremely clean! The bedding was the most comfortable type of fabric I have. The bathroom was very nice as well. The only thing I was dissapointed about was the bathroom door often slammed against the wall and grinding all night. I did not find the wine service anything but slow. Food was great as well. We very much desired a Chicago Restaurant. Mysterious Car which we took for a walk around the area. Restaurants in general are much more inviting than our hotel. We very much enjoyed staying at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers.
" 
====================
 "I stayed at the Hilton Chicago for my last business trip. I had a great deal and very few complaints. I was very pleased that we were able to stay so close to one of the great hotels in the city! We had a wonderful experience and would definitely return! 
" 
====================
 "A friend and I stayed here for a weekend while visiting a friend in Chicago. We have to stay here at the Hilton for both business and pleasure. It is true to say the rooms are top notch. The staff is fun and friendly. The location of the Hilton is gem town. If you are tired of walking to the sports stadiums all day, there is a Lodge at the pump that has fireworks on every floor. If you love Red Roof Inn and want a place to stay for night, there are no other higher quality hotels in this city. We will stay here again and think we will enjoy every minute of it. 
" 
====================
 "This is a beautiful hotel. We went to Chicago to see friend's and we were not disappointed. The staff was very friendly and the room was great. The decor is modern and you can't beat it. The bathroom is very nice and made of high quality glass and there are comfortable bedding. My son wants to try the Health and Fitness center which is nice because he gets all kinds of information about fitness. My son wants to use the fitness machines that are indoor, both in the room and out. I asked for a quiet room away from noisy night traffic and the quiet was the choice of the staff. There is a cafe right outside of the hotel that they serve coffee and hors d'oeuvres, both for $7.99 each. We ordered for 2 machines and both machines ran us $30 an hour. The 'champagne bar' was only 'free' and when I asked for it to be charged, it was a big disappointment. Also, I asked for a wireless internet and it was charged to my mobile phone when I asked for it to be charged. This is a very large hotel and I had to call and explain to them why I had charges for wireless internet and not for just internet. Additionally, the hotel does not have a breakfast buffet at each location. For example, I ordered a steak and a salad at the lobby, but the food was only free for breakfast. This is not a hotel that encourages shopping, even at the super-cheap locations. Overall, we had really bad service and very disappointing impressions.
" 
====================
 "First of all, the Ambassador East Hotel is located right in the heart of the Magnificent Mile and it seems as though all travelers to Chicago, regardless of their reason for visiting the city, will stay at this hotel. The clientele, the amenities, the restaurants and bars all seem to fit the bill. I would definately recommend this hotel to everyone that has stayed in the area and would be happy to stay here again. 
" 
====================
 "We booked a room at the Hyatt through Priceline.com for a weekend getaway and got a great rate. When we arrived we were greeted by a friendly staff and enjoyed our getaway. Our room was a perfect 25 minutes walk to the Clark Chicago Riverwalk, shopping and city streets. A wonderful place to stay when making your reservations. Will definitely stay here again. 
" 
====================
 "The Omni Chicago Hotel is amazing, from the rooms, staff, and best of all they are all the same. The only slight changes are the sheets they come in and the newer the better. Now all I can say is WOW!!! This is a great hotel and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great home away from home.
" 
====================
 "The Hotel Monaco is a fantastic hotel. I stayed there on business and found that it met my every need. The lobby was breathtaking, the room was clean and the staff was courteous. I was alarmed by the noise from adjoining rooms - I wanted to make sure no one heard me out of fear of being disturbed. I was alarmed by the quality of service from the valets who were on duty - thank them so much for making my stay here possible. 
" 
====================
 "I recently stayed at the James Hotel in Chicago, Il. For my stay I was there on business, and this was definitely a good experience. The customer service was incredible. From the time I walked in, I couldn't have found a better hotel. I especially enjoyed the atmosphere of the lobby, the drinks were sold out on the 28th, and the staff from reservations to check in were very helpful. I was told I could have a drink in the lobby any time any day, so I didn't need to ask for a tip. The room was spacious, and the beds are extremely comfortable. I've never stayed in a hotel where the layout of the room really gave me access to anything, and that's exactly why I had to move around so much. The bathroom was a nice size, and the shampoo and soap were really helpful. Overall I'd stay here again, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great hotel in Chicago, Il. 
" 
====================
 "We were in town on business, and booked this hotel for a romantic weekend getaway. I had a conference in the Gorge and the getaway was a great get-away for my wife and kids. The hotel minimally impressed us. We stayed in a 'small' room, rather than the spacious grand suite that is typical mid-rise hotels. The bathrooms were small, and in summer it's almost impossible to get a leak in one of the bathrooms. The pool and hot tubs were clean and water-friendly. Fun fact: the hotel sells hand sanitizer in its rooms. Fantastic! We could have stayed in any room in downtown Chicago or stayed in the red-line area, and got a great rate with (relatively) good service. Staff was very helpful. A+ (great!) to me was the need to get home at 4pm to pack away at the car. At the hotel, you are greeted by a smile and doors open up to reveal a spacious and elegant lobby. The whole experience was wonderful. 
" 
====================
 "I had a great experienc at the Talbott. I work for a cleaning service that many of us attend on a week-to-week basis. Our room was beautifully designed and spacious. I had forgotten my breakfast, milk, and juice! We ate in the restaurant's elegant bar and had a great view of the city from our rooms. The hotel is a National Historic Landmark so the staff has been extremely helpful. The location was great for us as well. We were able to walk to all of the local attractions including the museum's fish and chips menu and the Spa and Trabbathouse facilities. We ate at the conference center and the corporate dinner was underway with live jazz band. We were also able to eat the perfect 15 minutes early at Joe's Steakhouse. We loved the location and were so eager to visit the next level. We are definitely coming back. 
" 
====================
 "Stayed at this hotel for labor day weekend. Saw very poor review from others on comming in and seen some of the rooms where dust appeared on the carpeting and in some of the walls. Found two pieces of glass in the bathroom and came back, dirty underwear and dirty white sheets. Called down and they replaced the glass and they said they had not done anything to fix it and they put us in a different room. Nothing was done and nothing was done frankly! The manager at the hotel was rude and told me I had to go find out for myself! They should have been nicer to see what they had done wrong! Will not be staying here again.
" 
====================
 "I stayed at The James Hotel last week for a weekend getaway and I must say, I was NOT impressed. From the pictures I had seen online, I was expecting a luxury hotel with all the luxurious features I could possibly need. Unfortunately, my experience at the James was nothing less than a huge disappointment. To start with, the hotel was fairly clean and the room was great. Unfortunately, the service was terrible. I had to call in sick before my appointment was effective and when check in was on time I informed them of my ailment and demanded that I be given another room because the quality could not be guaranteed. Two hours later when I had checked in, they still did not come fix me my bill and after being so kind as to fix me my bill. Needless to say I was very tired and I was starving and it took three hours for them to finally come come get me my meal and give me the two we had paid for. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed and would recommend nothing more than to avoid this hotel.
" 
====================
 "I stayed at the Swissotel Chicago with my husband for a weekend while visiting some friends in Chicago. The location was perfect for us, we walked all over the place to check in and not a single valet came service helping us check in and then NEVER returned with our bags. The people at the front desk were nice enough and always seemed to have a good knowledge of the area. We will not be back to this old fashioned hotel!
" 
====================
 "I recently stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers and was very impressed. The hotel is very beautiful and the service was impeccable. The staff was very friendly and very helpful and the atmosphere was romantic. I was upgraded to a suite which was very comfortable and decorated nicely. I was very pleased that the air-condition was working and I could actually get to my room from the stairs. The bedrooms were very spacious and looked after by very nice and attentive staff. I also very much enjoyed the complimentary spa service and it was extremely relaxing and delicious. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that was looking for quiet, family friendly Chicago to visit with their two children.
" 
====================
 "We booked our room at the Knickerbocker Hotel looking for a romantic getaway. After booking the reservation we had to wait two days in front of the hotel before we could get to our room. For couples staying in the Chicago area or for a long weekend, this can be a problem. For us it was not a problem and for the price we paid we were expecting something close to a Holiday Inn type experience. We were expecting a modern, large room. Our room was not a King sized room as many were King sized. The bathroom was small and the toilet paper roll was 1/2" in diameter. The sheets were not clean and the towels were not high quality at all. The hotel was not very clean and we stayed in an untravaged property.
" 
====================
 "I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park and I must say, that staying at this hotel was one of my favorite experiences in all of travel. The view from my room was beautiful, the hotel staff was very friendly, and the room was very clean. The room smelled of old dog smell, which smelled good! The bedding were nice and they kept my bags and personal belongings clean. I really enjoyed the gym and spa facilities, I had the good luck of staying at the pool and very easy access to the everything that Michigan Avenue has to offer. Overall, I would strongly recommend this hotel for anyone wanting a nice hotel in an area that is attractive to tourists and/or business.
" 
====================
 "Over all, my trip was great. I got a top-notch award for the best accommodation for my family. But, it wasn't worth the money. The hotel looks nice, the service is slow, and the staff was extremely rude. I felt like I was having a public bathroom while dealing with the staff. And they even tried to coat me with a 'luxury' seal...which I couldn't or didn't! I asked one of the managers for a picture (he was on the staff), and she said she didn't have one...so she kept putting up a picture-taking Kimpton. All in all, the stay was great, and I wish there was a Kimpton for you!
" 
====================
 "This is the best hotel from the drop of a hat. I travel quite often and never had a hotel that I felt was this nice and recently. What a gorgeous hotel. We stayed in the King Deluxe room and it was roomy and very clean. It had a large room with a down pillow top,elevision,and marble baths. The large bathroom was very comfortable and had superb views of the city. The location is perfect for finding restaurants, walking the mint or loop. The gym is large and provides excellent hardpoints for running for your life. The hotel is also curtious and serves a great breakfast when you need it. Parking is high cost, so don't park your car downtown unless you have a good offer from a vendor. For those of us with children, the concierge had the best time was able to assist us. If you have a larger child, the catering was very good and the snack selection was very good. There isn't one luxury store within walking distance but there is a shopping mall with two blocks of cubic feet of indoor and outdoor seating. There aren't many chains offering this type of accommodations but the concierge helped us with our shopping needs. Overall, the hotel is a beautiful hotel and the a suites is a great place to stay. 
" 
====================
 "I recently had the opportunity to speak at length at the recent InterContinental conference of the Chicago Architecture and Modern Art Organizations. While this was my first visit to Chicago, I have to say I was very impressed with the guest services I received at this highly-acclaimed hotel. From the desk clerk for the InTouch International Hotwire conference to the concierge who arranged for my transportation, the staff at this incredibly affordable hotel rendered a positive service. I once had to wait twenty minutes for a 'fitness centre' that was recently completed. While the original indoor pool was unfinished, the indoor pool areas were beautifulled over in minutes. The indoor jogging path has received several upgrades and was recently enhanced to a final resting place for my loved ones. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting this great city.
" 
====================
 "We stayed at the Conrad Chicago with our two teenage daughters. The first room they brought us with them was a haven from the smart city lifestyle. The second room they gave us was a nightmare. Thought the walls must be so thin and everything must have been so wet from the previous rooms that it appeared as though the previous occupants had just left. Extremely disappointed. The previous occupants had not. They had just given us our first pay change. We didn't feel like going back home even though we had paid for the room. The management of the hotel has apologized but the recent reviews in the media have nothing on the rooms. The reviews are skewed, the photos are deceiving and the pictures really look nice though. We are going to have to stay here again. We were not.'s. or the reviews are completely wrong.
" 
====================
 "I just spent 3 nights at the Conrad Chicago and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality hotel in downtown Chicago. I stayed in the Hyatt Regency and loved it. I was here for a week long business trip, therefore I didn't have a lot of other options. I was very pleased with the location as well as the amenities available there. There is a fitness center, two swimming pools, two freezing cold televisions, a huge kitchen with cooking utensils, a huge wardrobe for leisureers, and a luxurious suite for guests to enjoy their vacation in Chicago. The entire Conrad family will be attending the wedding. The atmosphere was very chic and hip, not to mention the beachside view from most of downtown Chicago. I would recomend staying here if you want to experience the unique downtown Chicago experience and are just like me.
" 
====================
 "The hotel is in a good location. It is very modern and has a very nice interior. It has a very nice radio, tv, and health club. I used the Internet access for $18. This is a great deal for this very pricey hotel. I plan on staying again next time I am in Chicago!
" 
====================
 "I recently stayed at the Conrad Chicago and could not have expected much better. I am a mother of two children, one of which has severe asthma and Jaymes criteria for asthma (compared to my son's). My son loves the Chicago area and I look forward to visiting him when he is in college. He is handsome but has a very negative view of the Chicago area. Some of the things he does are disgusting (like vacuuming his bedroom door for mold) and disgusting others are positive. He is currently accepting applications for a Chicago office. I would certainly look forward to his success in visiting the Chicago area. 
" 
====================
 "Our stay at the Ambassador East Hotel was awesome! My wife and I had chosen the Chop Shop in Chicago for a getaway. As we were already super picky about room preferences, we decided to pick this hotel up simply because we were impressed with the hotel. Chop shops are just wonderful! Normally when I write reviews for these sites, I feel a bit lete about the actual experience. Anyway, when my wife went to check out after a long flight, I decided to see what the Chop Shop had to offer. I really couldn't have picked a better hotel. They had a really nice bar. They had a really nice room service. When I was done with my room, I called down to the front desk and asked to speak with a bellman. He was very nice about mine, and offered to bring me aorexicamines to make my bed. This was something I couldn't get at any other hotel. Although I was unable to see the point in staying in the hotel itself, I was able to relax in knowing that I will someday be able to relax in peace in their hotel. I recommend visiting the chicagoprince while you are in town. I also recommend the the Ambassador East while in Chicago. I will heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to relax while in the heart of the city Chicago. 
" 
====================
 "We put the mini bar to shame by charging almost twice what the regular bar does ($1.50). We were told over and over again by the staff that the mini bar is in the city and the staff is just like all big hotels: unsolicited recommendations and hand signals that will get you nowhere. I understand that this is rude and not helpful, but the people at the front desk are certainly not trained in customer service. I also was annoyed to see how long it took hotel staff to come to my room, if at all possible. Even with my alarm going off, I had to call twice within a few minutes to get my room key. Please, do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else. The Hilton Chicago is at least twice the price at a Best Western!
" 
====================
 "My wife and I stayed at the Swissotel in Chicago while on a long weekend getaway. We took the train straight from the port and got in pretty close to the hotel. The hotel is about 15 mins walk but we got no problems with being downtown. The lobby is a really big disappointment. The door/door to the rooms was both uncomfortable and doors slammed into the wall. One morning we were in our room on the 16th floor when we heard a shower sound and i could hear the tub opening and closing constantly. I called the front desk and they sent up a repair guy! We called back and they sent up another person to fix the shower, but it was still very uncomfortable. We also heard a motorcyclist going by your door on the road, so we asked if we could have a second guest in your room. They said no and we had 2 rooms. We got the room for about $25/night and it was very comfortable. The hotel is nice and has everything you could possibly need. We would stay here again and would recommend it to others.
" 
====================
 "I recently stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers, and had a wonderful experience! The hotel is in a great area called which the best part of staying at a hotel is the accommodations. I completely refered my review to their staff who had a lot of fun staying in hotels. They had fun going to the local attractions and I have to say I was very impressed with the cleanliness and the wonderful restaurant options at the hotel which was served with all my business. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago.
"

 "We stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago recently for a special weekend for my sons. We stayed there on business and found it well staffed and well decorated. The rooms were very clean and the staff was very friendly. We were very impressed with the prices and said that it was the best hotel for tourists and others who like a nice hotel in a nice location. We have stayed in many hotels in Chicago with great results and this one was different. The staff was friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean and the food was delicious. We have never had anything negative to say about the hotel. It's a 4 star hotel and I would be shocked if it wasn't for the employees.

====================
 "I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago and found it to be a fantastic hotel. My wife and I stayed on the 22nd floor overlooking the Chicago River. Of course, there were many restaurants and bars within walking distance. The rooms were well furnished with either flat screen or wired in/out. The view from our room was amazing. The pictures on the website show a beautiful view of the river, but I really couldn't find anything positive to write about. My phone was dead for my morning coffee call, and I woke up at 6am to find my wife on the ground floor of the room, trying to get ready for a meeting. I could have done with better bedding. Our room had a nice king sized bed, and the bathroom had a fast dryer between shower and sink. The hotel was also incredibly quiet. We didn't hear anything during the day, other than the motor cycle going on our floor. Our room was very comfortable with the huge televison and nice bathrobes. We drank at the hotel bar, which was very accomodating. Overall I would stay here again and would recommend it.

 "The Amalfi Hotel Chicago is one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever been in. I took advantage of the hotel's highly-priced packages and stayed here for a weekend in Chicago. The accommodations themselves were very nice, the hotel is very convenient to a lot of great shopping and dining places. The food in the restaurant was very tasty and the wait staff was very friendly. The hotel is in the center of downtown, which makes it perfect for pulling together a party or for a get-away party. It's also perfect for getting ready for a new job or for a romantic weekend with your girlfriend or something like that. I definitely went there for business, as it's commute is a lot less so. I didn't have any trouble with the hotel itself, it's just really nice to have the option to stay in one of its multiple guest suites. It's a huge city hotel and I'm amazed that I didn't have to deal with someplace totally different than any other Hilton around. It's a melting pot of cultures and it's amazing how not all people can feel that way about their own place! I definitely got a great reservation for the romantic weekend around and it was a hit! 
" 
====================
 "I am writing in regards to our stay at the Ambassador East Hotel. From the outside of the hotel, the building and lobby look like they can pass for luxury boutique hotels. The odors from the elevator car were disgusting. The odor was passed on to our luggage and when we checked in the ladies and gentlemen room just chilled. They were very attentive to our needs. The location of the hotel is great. Just a block from the Miracle Mile and Michigan Ave. Too. I would rate the Ambassadors worth five stars. I would also rate the hotel a four star. 
" 
====================
 "This hotel was a great place to stay! The hotel is clean, the service is great, and it has fun atmosphere! I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a fun, unique, urban hotel to stay in during the warmer months. The cold, reality TV-type aspects were kept away from the show, but it definitely was not a one-trick pony! The halls were dingy, the staff was rude, and the perks they offered were not thought of like all the other hotels in the area were. My biggest complaint about this place is the fitness room. It is tiny, and very small so we got hit with some of the noise. However, this doesn't make up for the gross, boring hotel experience. One of the things we like about Chicago is that it allows you to do amazing things with less hassle. We were really excited to take a trip to Chicago, but unfortunately that was not the case here. My husband was treated like we were a second-class guest, and not even a king! I then had to deal with the 'business as usual' mentality that just isn't good enough for a hotel of this quality. I'm glad we didn't have to deal with any unpleasantness. Overall, the hotel was nice, the room was nice, and the people at the front desk were very friendly. It was only a mediocre experience in and of itself, but considering it's price point, I won't be staying here.
" 
====================
 "I first walk into the lovely, black & white Bloomingdales in Chicago. I was floored by the chic & color vision of the room I was given. They go out of their way to make you feel comfortable - my room smelled of mildew and paints all the way, but the decor & decor amendments made me reconsider. The bed covers were not the most comfortable - the carpeting & slippers were quite uncomfortable - and the ONLY bathroom item on the bed was a water filter. Talk about a trash can! The room decor was very dark - decorated in a traditional hues of blue & white, & very little decorative decor. The linens & pillows were extremely uncomfortable - stained, or otherwise, no use. The decor upgrades were just absolutely horrendous. They even included a tiny 'wishbone' to your room's advantage - to the extent that you could have made a mental note of wishing that you had some days off. This was to be your home base when you visit Chicago; however, it has been ruined by this exact situation. No one who works here should ever stay there. It is simply inexcusable that they would choose to do such a thing.
" 
====================
 "We stayed here because of all the great reviews, and it's actually pretty good. The food was pretty good as well, for a 29-seat hotel. Not the cheapest kind, but it was fine. The location is perfect for downtown, shopping and dinning. If you want a nice room as a Holiday Inn, check it out.
" 
====================
 "The InterContinental Chicago is conveniently located near Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. The hotel is a wonderful place to stay and when I was away for a week, I spent less time there than I would have during normal business. The room that I stayed in had a great view of the Chicago River, which is a favorite of mine. The hotel staff was polite and gave me as much as I needed, giving me a discount or two and suggesting some places for my dinner. I ended up taking a taxi to the airport, which was quite pricey, but was better than what I paid at the airport. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!
" 
====================
 "The Hotel Allegro Chicago was by far the most pleasent place I've ever stayed. The only problem I had was that the service was terrible, the staff was rude to me, and the food in the restaurant was horrible. I ordered room service and it was so slow. The waiter even waited for 15 minutes while we were trying to order the food. It was so bad. My wife and I were not able to get on the bed as we were too tired. And the bed was too hard. It was very uncomfortable. My wife and I sat in the lobby and waited for 10 minutes until someone came along and just sat there. That was then when we could finally get our room cleaned. The hotel is in walking distance to the theater, mall and the subway. The hotel is also a few blocks downtown so it wasn't that hard to get a room here. The rooms are decent sized and have soft mattresses. The bathrooms are smaller but again, it's all in all, $69 a night is not too bad if you want a great hotel experience. I got the room with a corner suite with a beautiful view and it was very spacious and comfortable. The restaurant is also in walking distance to the theater, mall and the subway. I would definitely book another room if I can get a good deal in downtown Chicago.
" 
====================
 "Great Hotel! The staff was friendly, the atmosphere was that of a paradise. The rooms were very comfortable and quiet. The restaurants and shops were amazing. My only complaint would be that the wifi connection is expensive, but that's beside the hotel! 
" 
====================
 "We paid $75 a night through Priceline and got a great deal. We were surprised at the price drop of -24.50 for taxi to hotel. We were really expecting something between 25-35 but it was totally worth it! 
" 
====================
 "The hotel was immaculate and so elegant. The staff was polite, helpful and professional; always there for a special. The room was comfortable and clean, and the gold-plated bathrooms were very elegant. I couldn't find my MP3 player in the room, but if I'd needed to find it I'd switch to a different one. My room was clean, quiet, and just lovely. Location is excellent, there's really no better place to stay than the hotel.
" 
====================
 "The Omni Chicago Hotel is one of our favorite hotels in Chicago! LOVE IT! It is one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in. It is so close to restaurants, Shopping, Shopping City and many other amazing places. We walked around the Magnificent Mile, T-Rex Tranquility Building, Shedd Aquarium, Museum of Science and Industry, and many other amazing places. We also like to go to the Omni on business trips or just to hang out in the hotel for a day or two. We have stayed here several times and the experience will not be for the price! What a wonderful experience this place is by far. We love our hotels and this hotel is ours! 
" 
====================
 "I recently stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel and was very impressed with the elegant and luxurious decor. Ideal place for us to celebrate our anniversary. Happy to be back. Will definitely be back in the future. 
" 
====================
 "I stayed at the Talbott Hotel for 5 nights last month. I had a wonderful time. The location is terrific, attached to Nordstrom and Northbridge mall. The room was spacious and very clean. The bed was extremely comfortable. The staff was all friendly and went out of their way to bemr helpin. I will defenitely stay there again in a heartbeat.
" 
====================
 "This is the best hotel I have stayed at in Chicago. I have to say the Palmer House is by far the best hotel to look away from the event. The rooms, the decor, the the the staff is extremely helpful, all of which made me feel away from the event even though I knew that this is the hotel that John the Heiress stayed at. She ate from the most delicious restaurant in the city, Sichuan Cantina, and she even paid for our air and hotel room. This was the most comfortable hotel I have ever been to. The rooms, the decor, the room is gorgeous. I love how they have high speed internet. I used to stay at the Hyatt and whenever I went out I had great service there too, whenever I went to use the fitness center, it was perfect. I used to stay in the Mercury Room but it has been refurbished since I last used it, the beautiful and plush bathroom was a present from the man who controlled my vanity. I also had the wonderful experience of staying in the study by the pool, it is one of the most relaxing and friendly reading is funest place. Finally, the study is very close to the shopping area, I felt as if I was walking around it. But, I have to say I was very impressed with the artistic sensibility of the room and the fact that I had a partial picture of the wall painting. And, I found the coffee maker to be a partial match of the high end and quality of the room. On top of this, the bathroom is very nice as well, an excellent addition to any room. Finally, I would recommend the hotel to anyone needing to escape to the city very soon, and given the rate of $200/night, it is very possible that this was a very dear to the hotel's soul. 
" 
====================
 "The Swissotel Chicago is a delight to visit. Architecturally stunning, it is a classic, comfortable place to retire to in the summer. The hotel is also beautifully quiet. I love that. In my three nights here, I was able to relax in the plush rooms with free wifi. The hotel also has a great restaurant on-site. The chef, Quentin Tarantino, passed away last week. This is a place I will definitely be staying at again.
" 
====================
 "I stayed at this hotel for 5 days in July 2010. The room was spacious and very clean. The bathroom was spacious and kept my wife up all night long. The bed was very comfortable and the room was elegant. I would definitely recommend to anyone considering staying in Chicago.
" 
====================
 "I stayed here for a weekend with my son and we had a great experience. The hotel is very centrally located, so we did not get much going for our weekend. However, the lobby and reception areas were so well decorated that we and other customers were not tired after our long waits. The room we had was spacious and very nice, and we were able to work all night without using the beds. Despite having paid for the King bed package, we did not partake of the spa services and was left with a very unpleasant experience of collection of the charges, stolen items from the safes, and the like.
" 
====================
 "We stayed at the Hard Rock hotel in Chicago recently for our anniversary. The location is awesome - right in the heart of the city - there really are not that many easy walking tours that you can do if you want to pay very little for the privilege. The rooms really were clean and the beds really comfy. We didn't really want to go out much and stayed in the Park Suite so we got a really quiet room. The restaurant food was really good and I really enjoyed having my own personal steamer cup in the place. The wireless internet was really pricey but really liked the extra pillow around the neck where I could keep my clothes dry. I really, really enjoyed my stay there and I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in the city nicely. 
" 
====================
 "I recently had the opportunity to stay at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago and was very impressed. In addition to the fabulous accommodations in the building, my stay at the Hard Rock Hotel was just amazing. They have a huge selection of dresses and gowns for guests to wear when they are in the city, which they offer the guests at the end of their stay able to check into a suite that is a little larger than a regular hotel. My suite was beautiful as well. It was decorated in a manner that was both modern and comfortable for guests. The lobby area is beautiful as well, with views of the Chicago River and the lake. I was very pleased with the spa treatments they offer their guests. I fully recommend their services. My stay at the Hard Rock Hotel left much to be wished.
" 
====================
 "After reading some of the most recent reviews I'm really perplexed. I didn't know what to expect, but I was most pleasantly surprised. Just as all the past reviews, both negative and positive, have stated, you can't beat the location of this hotel. It's perfect. We stayed in the Millenium Knickerbocker for a week. On the first weekend it was downright hot - and then we were even more shocked when we asked to switch to a Swissotel for the remainder of our stay. The room was small, the bathroom small, the room very quiet, but it was everything we were looking for. The wireless internet was free and there was a fridge in the bathroom. We were thrilled to see that so we were sure that we would have plenty to eat on our next trip to Chicago. If we were in the Chicago area and we are looking for a hotel of any value, we would think twice about this property. We have stayed here before and almost always stay into the summer with our next company. We stayed my own Super 8 Mile Hotel in San Francisco. It was perfect. We had peace and quiet the next morning. If you are looking for a super hotel in Chicago, look no more! I updated my reviews on the hotel and got a new one for my money. I highly recommend this place. If you have any complaints about the room or what went wrong, just leave a comment below and tell us how great it is.
" 
====================
 "Guys stay at the Hyatt in Chicago and have to say yes! The staff is so friendly and make me feel welcome. The food is good and the room is comfortable and spacious. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would rate it 5 out of 5 stars.
" 
====================
 "My son & I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago this summer. We took a trip to Chicago with our two teenage daughters. We were blown away by the luxury that this hotel has to offer. The prices are very reasonable, and the services are top notch. This is a very boutique hotel, and coming from a strong downtown and business background, making him or her in Chicago a few dollars off the price would certainly not hurt either. The location is also within walking distance to lots of great restaurants and stores. As our baby came along, we were a bit of pamperedgo, spending more time with our younger son and more of it with our grandmotherishingess. The hotel is also a short distance to a lot of great shopping, including Sears Tower, Bloomingdales, and Johnson's. We were very pleased to see that the breakfast buffet was very much in vogue, and the coffee and juice bars welling up with frothy, caffeic and delicious coffee and juice. I also met some of the girls in the business center, coffee and coffee, wonderful. I will definitely be staying with them again in the future. 
" 
====================
 "I was very much looking forward to my stay at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago, but was surprised by the state of disrepair we found there. From the moment we walked into the lobby the staff was nothing but smiles and hospitality. As soon as I put my foot down to see the view of the city, I knew this was a place where elegance and customer service could make a big difference. My room was dirty and I complained on the phone to the front desk when I got home that it was because they didn't like me. The truth is, I was really looking forward to staying here for the rest of my days, but just wanted to get away from the city and do some shopping. I ended up doing the shopping in the Jewel Boutique located across the street by the hotel and they had something special on offer, making it a steal. Plus it was a great location for shopping as well. I would definitely stay here again!
" 
====================
 "The InterContinental Chicago is a beautiful hotel. I was very impressed by the location. From the moment I stepped inside the room was sparkling with history. The lobby was elegant and beautiful. The room was very elegant and beautiful. I really enjoyed the amazing bathroom. I would recommend to everyone I know. This is a very comfortable, fun, relaxing place to stay. I highly recommend the InterContinental Chicago. I would stay here again any time, in any kind of capacity, in Chicago. What more could you want?
" 
====================
 "This hotel is in a great city, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in the downtown Chicago area. The rooms are spacious and well-appointed, and the accommodations are exceptional. We loved our stay at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers, for which we pay very much. The location is terrific--view from the rooms is walking distance to all the interesting buildings in the area. The hotel is also beautifully appointed, for added charm and ambiance. Best of all, the hotel is conveniently located, too, a two-minute walk from the Magnificent Mile. So, too, for all the great shopping and fun that is possible there. I would highly recommend this hotel, for all its shortcomings! 
" 
====================
 "The Omni is one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever stayed in. The fact that it is located in the Chicago Loop, Water Tower, Mile, Millennium Park, Navy Pier and the Magnificant Mile are just to mention a million miles, the amazing food and spa services all completely changed my mind about the Omni. I was so impressed that I upgraded my room to a king with a queen instead of a king as I originally booked my own room. The wonderful customer service and the fabulous amenities made my stay there a wonderful one, I will definitely consider staying there again!
" 
====================
 "I recently had the opportunity to stay at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago. I had heard they were a nice hotel that was a little bit expensive, but I was completely happy when I stayed there. The location was perfect for my trip, we arrived late in the day and got good service food at a great rate. The room was very clean and had all the amenities I could ask for. I asked for a quiet room and I have not had that at any other hotel in my life. That being said, there are enough issues with this hotel that I would not recommend it to anyone. 1) The elevators can be a bit slow. Both times we were on the street and on foot we were overcharged an amount that was seemingly in the hundreds! 2) The pool is not open to the floor but facing the pool you have to walk to it. 3) The towels are not always clean. My wife got a bad bad throbbing throbbing on one occasion and my wife on a hot day has a bad throbbing on another time. If you go out of your way to get a massage, this could very well ruin your experience. It also took her twenty minutes to get a massage. There is a restaurant in the grounds restaurant that serves a buffet every morning. When my wife went to the restaurant she usually got a bone-in steak. The restaurant food was horrible. I do not go to business meetings, however when we did go to that restaurant they had burnt burgers, croissants and dips. So my meals were different and my wife had to eat them herself. Needless to say my experience was not worth the wordsmith's 'go figure it'.
" 
====================
 "We stayed at the Swissotel in early August 2004. It was really busy and the room was very noisy. So I asked for a new king or sofrap and it was actually a king. My husband was very excited because it was supposed to be a $49 a night room. He was really worried since it was supposed to be a suite. It is supposed to be a suite. It is supposed to be a suite. It is supposed to be a suite. It is supposed to be a suite. It is supposed to be a suite. It is supposed to be a suite. It is supposed to be a suite. It is supposed to be a suite. It is supposed to be a suite. It is supposed to be a suite. It is supposed to be a suite. It was really busy and the room was very loud. The keycard was broken so we asked for another one and it was really expensive there. The restaurant food was really good and friendly. The location is really good for a downtown Chicago restaurant. The decor really suits what we are doing. We really like the James building and it is very modern. It is very quiet and the view is very great. Our only complaint is that the service there was a little slow. We were not helped by the fact that our party didn't make it in and leave the hotel. So get a cab! 
" 
====================
 "I was recently in Chicago visiting a daughter and my two pimps came into my room and took care of the rest. I was able to get my room upgraded to the magnificent presidential suite. The room was excellently furnished and was in perfect shape. I couldn't believe the prices for the best accommodations. I couldn't imagine what the world would be like without the luxurious products. I couldn't and will not stay anywhere else in Chicago.
" 
====================
 "The Palmer House Hilton was once one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. I stayed there on business and found it to be a great value for the amount of money that I paid for it. Upon my arrival I decided to check in and not settle for nothing - my reservation had been messed up - and they screwed up my goldfish. Arrival was nothing short of exceptional - and I would not return - I needed new towels, new chairs, new sheets, etc. The staff was friendly but not helpful - basically, they valued your privacy too much for me to go outside in your room and not touch. If I would have known at the front desk about the problems with the room I would have reported her sooner.
" 
====================
 "We stayed here because of all the great reviews on TripAdvisor, but instead we went to the Talbott. It's reviews are little merit awards and don't do enough to motivate you to spend money. The Talbott (also called The Talbott Hotel) is a $69 + taxicab uber-class hotel. If I pay a premium price, I would expect better service and an 18th century layout. In any event, we felt that the weekend we stayed here was a waste. It's size was average, the room was dirty, and the lighting was poor. The food was stale, and the cup I ordered was bland and not cooked to our needs. If we had stayed in a regular hotel, we would have gotten a much better room (not as nice a view, but better food, more room to sleep) and would have enjoyed the stay here. But we didn't. Our room cost us $725 more per night than we paid at the hotel with the same price. It was not a good stay.
" 
====================
 "My wife and I stayed here for a weekend and we absolutely loved it. The only thing is we are not in the room walking people in. It is nice though. It is on the small side compared to other suites at the hotel but not ugly. It is clean though and does not smell like a hotel room. It is definitely a notch or two above the rest. If you are going to stay here, do it! 
" 
====================
 "I recently stayed at the James Hotel in Chicago, Il. From the get go, I was greeted friendly and was assured I would be a good part of the renovations. I arrived early and was informed that the renovations was going to be afoot. When I got to my room (on the 6th floor) I discovered a rather large sink in the bathroom which was replaced with a floor sink which I had to bring (once again) to get to my normal sink level (once again, once again...) Since I'm a shy person, I was extra careful with the bathroom (and slippers) before checking in. Apparently they don't have as many shallow sinks as they like to have, so in lieu of a face value room, I got a two legged friend feature and had access to shower, tub, and separate sitting room. Dont forget to check out the stunning pool on the 32nd floor. I'll be back soon. --David" 
====================
 "We really enjoyed our stay! The hotel was clean and the staff was excellent. The room was gorgeous! The decor is modern and the bathrooms are so clean, we didn't even have to search through the bathroom for the candles! We were pleased to know that they provide a high speed wireless internet connection for those who desire. The room also had a great view of the Chicago Skyline. The hotel is located on South Michigan Avenue, and right next to the Tribune Tower. We would definetly come back!
" 
====================
 "We stayed at the Hard Rock hotel in Chicago last year and can say i was a huge fan. The location couldn't be better right off I-95 in that area and an hour walk to basically all the best shopping and eating in the city. The rooms were spacious and even had full sized TVs which I loved since I love dogs. The bathroom had machine wash products on the floor so I didn't have to wash my face all day. The beds were comfortable and the beds were some of the best I ever slept in. I would recommend trying the restaurant in the hotel because it was worth every penny. 
" 
====================
 "I recently had the opportunity to speak at length with one of my patients about their experience with the Chicago Palmer House. My concern was treated with some warmth and respect. Upon my presentation, I was given a small room with no view. Rather, I was given a larger room with a view. The room was spacious and luxurious, with every amenity a traveler would desire. My patient was absolutely stunned by the size of the room. He is eligible for a king size bed and this stunning room. The room is suited for the most rigorous of training. It is undergoing a major renovation, and will be undergoing major renovations in the near future. It is staffed with first rate employees who have recently been laid off. The renovation will almost certainly take up 40 years to complete, and it is extremely expensive. Although I was completely impressed with the building and the room, I will not be staying at the Palmer House again.
" 
====================
 "I recently stayed in the Hotel Allegro Chicago and found it to be a fantastic hotel. My wife and I had not been aware of the hotel when we were there, but when we arrived the first thing we noticed was the lighted bothEngineDebugceptively and it was a beautiful hotel. The lobby and bar was perfect and the view was awesome. As we left in the early hours of the morning we took advantage of the complimentary breakfast, which was great as we were looking forward to the weekend in Chicago. They did not have tickets offered by the hotel, but instead gave us a free breakfast which we oohed and aaaayed. The front desk staff was very friendly, and when we told the front desk clerk we were tired and going to Chicago, she was very kind and said that was all she could tell us. We flew into Chicago and stayed at the hotel the next morning, which was the best part of our stay. It was a huge relief to see that house-keeping had not changed, although I have to take waking up a little easier than I have in the past. I also wanted to mention that they have a terrific wine list that comes complete with,'One Drop Water For All The Spots', which is a huge plus' We will definitely be coming back for another stay.' The front desk staff was very friendly and helpfull and the day-to-day workings of the hotel are very impressive, especially in how they manage their customers. Jameson is a great hotel to visit and I can't wait to see what they have in store for the Chicago market. 
" 
====================
 "The Swissotel Chicago is a delight to visit. Located in downtown Chicago this hotel has nine different styles of room accommodations to serve everyones taste. They have children friendly rooms where kids can sleep on the big sofas and heeled chairs. They have real butter on the sheets with sheets that kids can take home. They have free internet in the rooms which is great for working and lonely time. The hotel has many places to eat and there are a few bars and a nightclub for the rich that is close by. This hotel is not just like home but also at night it is very noisy and dangerous. They offer great rates but do not order from the ppl. This hotel is a great place to stay if you have the money. 
" 
====================
 "We stayed at the Knickerbocker Hotel looking for a relaxing weekend away from the kids. We were excited about the free wi-fi and all the kits provided with each room were really nice. We got a corner room with a breathtaking view of downtown Chicago. We were not disappointed in our stay. We have not stayed here again and I think that's what made us want to bring our iPod to Chicago. It was a relaxing experience away from the big-city life. The staff really made us feel like royalty. They were friendly, kind, and professional. It was a very relaxed atmosphere with great tables and drinks in the restaurant and the staff really made us feel at home. We ate at the hotel's restaurant Zest, which was really tasty and the food was the best we had hoped for. We had a great time. The hotel is in walking distance to the theater district,the shopping districts,the restaurant - everything you could want. It's a walking distance to the subway and the bus stop for the whole Chicago Subway is almost a walkable city. We definitely stayed at Zest for our entire stay in Chicago. Zest is still going strong for Chicago. 
" 
====================
 "I recently stayed here at the Talbott Hotel, in downtown Chicago. The hotel is sleek and modern with a a great selection of cocktail receptions and events. The restaurant 'The Talbott' serves the room well and the bar has a good selection. Our room was spacious and very comfortable. I would recommend staying here to anyone. It is close to shopping and interesting. I would also recommend staying here if you want to stay in a cozy, safe and high-quality hotel.
" 
====================
 "The Ambassador East Hotel is a wonderful experience for guests and the guests are treated with courtesy and warmth. Guests love the trendy decor and exciting style created by the hotel. The hotel is located in a chic corner part of the city near the Water Tower. The hotel is in a spotless state of decor. The rooms are spacious and beautiful and the hotel is a place to stay when you are not going to stay that way. I loved the location and knew that when I walked into a really great hotel, that I would be treated with courtesy and warmth. If you are visiting Chicago for the first time and are traveling with a smoker, there is a good chance that your stay at the Ambassador East Hotel will be without a smoke. There are no smoking areas in the city and the concierge staff does a great job of finding and matching places to share her business experiences. All of the guest rooms are suites and the amenities are not as abundant as some hotels in the area. However, the rooms are spacious and the lobby is beautiful. The Hard Rock Hotel has a beautiful lobby and very nice service. The Hard Rock offers many of the same services as the Ambassador East Hotel but the service is more extensive. There are guest rooms for guest use which are suited for large groups and are suited to very specific guests. The Hard Rock has a restaurant on each floor serving the most pleasurable meal and the service is extensive. There are many restaurants in the city and walking distance to the many shopping places. The Hard Rock is a great place to stay if you want to relax and unwind with your wife as you are visiting Chicago for the first time. The Hard Rock is a great place to check-in to your usual activities and the rooms are well equipped with leisure amenities. The Hard Rock is close to the action and the downtown is like a movie-star. The rooms are well decorated and the staff is courteous and friendly. The Hard Rock is in business, not luxury. The Hard Rock is close to all of the great restaurants, theaters, and business centers in Chicago. It is business as usual for the prices and the amenities are very substantial. There is one guestroom per floor and you can room-move as you like and as you like as you like. The service is excellent and the staff is very friendly and courteous. There are two bars on each floor and there are huge, immaculately lit ones downstairs. If you lurve the chocolate fountain drink, chances are, you will like it. If you want to eat in the lobby, it is a horribly long, creepy walk through crowded areas and you all feel like you are a burden to the people around you. If you want to party, there are plenty of places to go in the immediate area, but the food and drinks are now closed indefinitely. Oh, and the Ambassador East Hotel is surly, underwhelming, and possibly a haunted house. I hesitate as to what to say about this, since I have never been so ambivalent about a hotel's character. I do say that even in business I find it very difficult to completely trust what I see and feel. The Hard Rock, the rooms, the people, the place, the place. If you like a hotel with 2,000 other stars, I suggest you do the opposite. Go somewhere else.

 "IMO this hotel is too good to be true. The only good thing it lacks in terms of amenities and amenities is in terms of decor. The inside is so dingy and dirty it looks like it was designed by Jules Verne. The lights are so dimmer than it's not even been renovated and the rooms are so small they must be kept out of the room all night. If you're traveling to Chicago and you want a nice room and a washroom, go elsewhere.

 "I stayed at the Fairmont Chicago for one night following a business meeting at an up-and-coming hotel. I mean, REALLY. I wasn't the first person to notice the equestrian outing offered was a bit of a bust. Sure, it is in the downtown area, but where's the equestrian rally going to be located? It's not even in the city! And the parking is ridiculously expensive (the $48 rate worked out handsomely.) We reserved a room on the 10th floor for one of the conference meetings. While we were waiting for the elevator to slow down (the reception was already in the elevator pen when we arrived) we got shoved into a 'plain white' room just before going on. HORRIBLE! The receptionist had the same 'article' on the front desk a few weeks earlier that had a window at the rate of $22/night. Guess what the guy said? It was a bargain! We got off at the wrong elevators, waited on a white guy who was trying to be helpful and then had to wait like three minutes to get to the front desk. We were supposed to have a drink in the lobby, but as we were checking in there was ice left in the glasses! Don't they know that? While we were here we had to wait twenty minutes for a plumber to come by to fix a shower? Really. The room was brand new and had only been painted over several times. When I arrived at the room I excluded the ice and the shower time because they are iconographic. The hotel is conveniently located with two restaurants: the Westin and the Palmer House.The location was great. We had a great time. We will not stay here again.

 "Our stay at the Swissotel was by far the best that we have ever spent at a Chicago hotel. The service was impeccable, the staff was very helpful and the location was great. Our room was spacious and very clean, unlike many hotels I have stayed at before. The only thing I would say is be careful with is the toilet in the bathroom. It didn't leak too much and didn't seem to get very many drops of water. I also tried the coffee and water in the tub but it was small and not very well placed. We also tried the valet parking but it was very far from the hotel and made getting around any real easy. We drove ourselves to and from the hotel a challenge. The valet parking had two valets over one floor with parking facing each other. When one of the valets came down hard on the other floor of the van, the carpark was very close to the carpark, making getting around the carpark a breeze. The food in the restaurant was so over the top and the wait staff was way too slow. We were only in the hotel for 1 night, but that was the limit of our trip. We will definitely go back to the Swissotel and try other hotels in the future.

 "I stayed at Embassy Suites in Chicago during a recent business trip. I loved the neighborhood feel and was very impressed with the character and the hustle of the area. I loved the hotel and I will definitely stay there again when I'm in Chicago. -- Scott D. Galloway

 "I recently stayed here at the InterContinental Hotel in Chicago, Il. While I was not a huge fan of the hotel, I was not disappointed. The location is what made it palatable, the staff was very friendly and the food was as good as or better than what I would have at a comparable hotel in Chicago. The room was in a great state of repair, having been cleaned twice in the room. No dust, but the wallpaper on the bed was so wrinkled and peeling from the adhesive around the base. The bathroom was so small it was difficult to get the toilet seat out. The carpet was so thin that it was hard to see the ground. The only redeeming feature of the room was that its kitchen was located there. Although the room was spacious, I couldn't get used to the fact that I had a healthy healthy appetite. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a place to stay in downtown Chicago.

 "Thanks for reviewing my stay and will be looking forward to another review in the future. I have stayed at many hotels and this one is my favorite. Straight forward statement about hotel and location making up for the lack of information. Staff is excellent, staff is plentiful, room is clean, romantic, etc. The switch to sleep like a Clark Street Hotel customer was a great touch. Parking nearby seems right up my alley.

 "A somewhat chilly windy day when we first stepped into the hotel. Gorgeous lady at the front desk was so kind that we got a pillowcase full of goodies from the valetshop. Also very helpful lady at the check in desk was a wonderful girl. We were upgraded to a King bed suite. The suite was very spacious and had everything we needed. I especially loved the bathroom. One of the coolest features was the bedroom. You could put your feet up against the wall and have a fantastic sound system. The beds were fantastic! The rooms were very spacious and had everything we needed. I would recommend getting a pass. You can also choose from a luxurious in room with a seperate room for the in room spa and a workout room. We also got an in house gym. One of the best perks of the trip was the ability to carry our bags up to our rooms via cab when we did not use the hotel's elevators. We then shared the room with other passengers and were able to go to our next of kin at the airport. The Ambassador East is set to be renovated into a luxury hotel within 2 months. Oh and did I mention the spa? We didn't even have to leave our hotel to benefit from this special day.
