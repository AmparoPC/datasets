1,"""I recently had the opportunity to stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park and had a great stay. The hotel is small but cozy. The service is top notch. I felt as if I was a celebrity guest at this hotel. The room was on the 3rd level and the beds were extremely comfortable. The view from my room was amazing and not a bit away from the hotel. The prices were very reasonable for what I paid. I would stay there again the next time I visit Chicago.",

4,"""I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel, and it was the best choice my husband and I ever had! From the look of the hotel, it certainly looks like a modern day Hyatt. Not old-worldy like many hotels I have stayed at, it is spacious and comfortable. It is clean, modern, and has a classy decor that I have only come to appreciate while staying in Chicago. The rooms are clean and spacious, and the bed is absolutely comfortable! I have never had a bad stay at this hotel, and I am looking forward to coming back as I book online now.",

The location couldn't be beat, distance from the city was perfect and the staff was very friendly and polite. We got a room with a king size bed that was very comfortable and had everything you could need when in town. The bathroom was a nice size with a nice water based shower stall. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the Chicago area.",

I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool, one white phone and one white phone, to call the desk. Both were out of service!!!! I am glad there wasn't an emergency. As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean.... never heard back. One more thing, in our room the furniture was mostly child friendly except for a large metal and glass outdated coffee table. Within 30 minutes my 5 year old fell and hit her mouth and began bleeding. They need to update this piece of furniture.",

I landed the hotel through Priceline for $80 per night and paid an additional $75 per night for a suite on the 41st floor. My two young boys loved it as the view was unbelieveable and the pool on the 42nd floor was easily accessible. I found all the employees that we interfaced with to be very friendly and accommodating. I will return to the Hyatt anytime!",

I was given a nice room with great views of the lake and I've come to love being able to go to the beach and the Navy Pier. And the rooms are absolutely exquisite. Best of all, the Omni is conveniently located near the Navy Pier and Navy Parks. I really couldn't have asked for a better Omni.

49,"""Review's a little late, but... My husband & I first stayed at the Allegro in June, '05. I was very excited since it was kind of a boy's club location, but our excitement soon turned to disappointment when we were transferred to the EL. Terrible seats, terrible lighting, and the 'L'--like the '-- was nowhere to be found. By the time we got to the room, it was July gone by then! There was no key card for our car, so we had to drive 160 + miles to get there (we took the money we could out of our account before the event). When we got to the hotel, the parking service was terrible and was terrible enough to make us miss the party. NO EXTRAONS I know this is a super small hotel, but when you're traveling with a child in tow you tend to be more hesitant about putting your stuff in places where it won't be found. This was particularly disappointing as we were looking for an easy place to sleep that didn't have pajamas. We could have stayed up and spent our break away time somewhere else.",

52,"""My visit to the Conrad Chicago was a pleasure from the moment I stepped foot on the red carpet. The front desk clerks were polite and helpfull, the chocolates included were so much fun, I honestly felt like I was on a family vacation. The place was cozy and elegantly dressed to impress, especially when I had my own money! The food was to die for, very much considered but definitely considered here. I also really enjoyed the staff's work. As I dipped into the night sky, I envisioned a group of four of me taking a bath in a sexy sundecke. The masseuse was friendly as can be tell you, he brought me a massage for my hard cock, and I was even able to take a picture with him with my laptop up... even post-apocalyptic! I was new to the hotel, but felt like a celebrity after my experience. I'll definitely be staying here again on my next trip out.",

I was able to use the in-room coffee service and the in-room massage service. I was very impressed by the food. It was tasty! My last update was on my stay the next day, and I could not believe it!

When I arrived, I was greeted by very friendly AND BEAUTIFUL staff. They were very helpful with the relaxing part of the vacation, which seemed to include a massage. After a luxurious room with European flare, I was shown to my room so I could try the food provided by the restaurant. I also enjoyed the in-room spa service, which was just as amazing. I was given a long-lasting, luxurious massage. While I did not partake of the standard spa treatments, I'm sure you will too. The staff was just as friendly and helpful. Finally, after a relaxing day of sightseeing, I was offered a complimentary breakfast at the hotel. The perfect time to reflect and unwind after a relaxing day of sightseeing! The staff were so friendly and helpful, that I now take them on business trips and provide them with my maps for all my shopping needs. I love their customer service. I will so time their deals well.",

The only thing I was dissapointed about was the bathroom door often slammed against the wall and grinding all night. I did not find the wine service anything but slow. Food was great as well.

The bathroom is very nice and made of high quality glass and there are comfortable bedding. My son wants to try the Health and Fitness center which is nice because he gets all kinds of information about fitness. My son wants to use the fitness machines that are indoor, both in the room and out. I asked for a quiet room away from noisy night traffic and the quiet was the choice of the staff. There is a cafe right outside of the hotel that they serve coffee and hors d'oeuvres, both for $7.99 each. We ordered for 2 machines and both machines ran us $30 an hour. The 'champagne bar' was only 'free' and when I asked for it to be charged, it was a big disappointment. Also, I asked for a wireless internet and it was charged to my mobile phone when I asked for it to be charged. This is a very large hotel and I had to call and explain to them why I had charges for wireless internet and not for just internet. Additionally, the hotel does not have a breakfast buffet at each location. For example, I ordered a steak and a salad at the lobby, but the food was only free for breakfast. This is not a hotel that encourages shopping, even at the super-cheap locations. Overall, we had really bad service and very disappointing impressions.",

I've never stayed in a hotel where the layout of the room really gave me access to anything, and that's exactly why I had to move around so much.

The hotel minimally impressed us. We stayed in a 'small' room, rather than the spacious grand suite that is typical mid-rise hotels. The bathrooms were small, and in summer it's almost impossible to get a leak in one of the bathrooms. The pool and hot tubs were clean and water-friendly. Fun fact: the hotel sells hand sanitizer in its rooms. Fantastic! We could have stayed in any room in downtown Chicago or stayed in the red-line area, and got a great rate with (relatively) good service. Staff was very helpful. A+ (great!) to me was the need to get home at 4pm to pack away at the car. At the hotel, you are greeted by a smile and doors open up to reveal a spacious and elegant lobby.

The hotel is a National Historic Landmark so the staff has been extremely helpful. The location was great for us as well. We were able to walk to all of the local attractions including the museum's fish and chips menu and the Spa and Trabbathouse facilities.

Our room was not a King sized room as many were King sized. The bathroom was small and the toilet paper roll was 1/2"" in diameter.

The large bathroom was very comfortable and had superb views of the city. The location is perfect for finding restaurants, walking the mint or loop. The gym is large and provides excellent hardpoints for running for your life. The hotel is also curtious and serves a great breakfast when you need it. Parking is high cost, so don't park your car downtown unless you have a good offer from a vendor. For those of us with children, the concierge had the best time was able to assist us. If you have a larger child, the catering was very good and the snack selection was very good. There isn't one luxury store within walking distance but there is a shopping mall with two blocks of cubic feet of indoor and outdoor seating.

The pictures on the website show a beautiful view of the river, but I really couldn't find anything positive to write about. My phone was dead for my morning coffee call, and I woke up at 6am to find my wife on the ground floor of the room, trying to get ready for a meeting. I could have done with better bedding. Our room had a nice king sized bed, and the bathroom had a fast dryer between shower and sink. The hotel was also incredibly quiet. We didn't hear anything during the day, other than the motor cycle going on our floor. Our room was very comfortable with the huge televison and nice bathrobes.

The cold, reality TV-type aspects were kept away from the show, but it definitely was not a one-trick pony! The halls were dingy, the staff was rude, and the perks they offered were not thought of like all the other hotels in the area were. My biggest complaint about this place is the fitness room. It is tiny, and very small so we got hit with some of the noise. However, this doesn't make up for the gross, boring hotel experience. One of the things we like about Chicago is that it allows you to do amazing things with less hassle. We were really excited to take a trip to Chicago, but unfortunately that was not the case here. My husband was treated like we were a second-class guest, and not even a king! I then had to deal with the 'business as usual' mentality that just isn't good enough for a hotel of this quality. I'm glad we didn't have to deal with any unpleasantness. Overall, the hotel was nice, the room was nice, and the people at the front desk were very friendly.

The bed covers were not the most comfortable - the carpeting & slippers were quite uncomfortable - and the ONLY bathroom item on the bed was a water filter. Talk about a trash can! The room decor was very dark - decorated in a traditional hues of blue & white, & very little decorative decor. The linens & pillows were extremely uncomfortable - stained, or otherwise, no use. The decor upgrades were just absolutely horrendous. They even included a tiny 'wishbone' to your room's advantage - to the extent that you could have made a mental note of wishing that you had some days off.

The rooms are decent sized and have soft mattresses. The bathrooms are smaller but again, it's all in all, $69 a night is not too bad if you want a great hotel experience.

My wife got a bad bad throbbing throbbing on one occasion and my wife on a hot day has a bad throbbing on another time. If you go out of your way to get a massage, this could very well ruin your experience. It also took her twenty minutes to get a massage.

I loved the location and knew that when I walked into a really great hotel, that I would be treated with courtesy and warmth. If you are visiting Chicago for the first time and are traveling with a smoker, there is a good chance that your stay at the Ambassador East Hotel will be without a smoke. There are no smoking areas in the city and the concierge staff does a great job of finding and matching places to share her business experiences. All of the guest rooms are suites and the amenities are not as abundant as some hotels in the area. However, the rooms are spacious and the lobby is beautiful. The Hard Rock Hotel has a beautiful lobby and very nice service. The Hard Rock offers many of the same services as the Ambassador East Hotel but the service is more extensive. There are guest rooms for guest use which are suited for large groups and are suited to very specific guests. The Hard Rock has a restaurant on each floor serving the most pleasurable meal and the service is extensive. There are many restaurants in the city and walking distance to the many shopping places. The Hard Rock is a great place to stay if you want to relax and unwind with your wife as you are visiting Chicago for the first time. The Hard Rock is a great place to check-in to your usual activities and the rooms are well equipped with leisure amenities. The Hard Rock is close to the action and the downtown is like a movie-star. The rooms are well decorated and the staff is courteous and friendly. The Hard Rock is in business, not luxury. The Hard Rock is close to all of the great restaurants, theaters, and business centers in Chicago. It is business as usual for the prices and the amenities are very substantial. There is one guestroom per floor and you can room-move as you like and as you like as you like. The service is excellent and the staff is very friendly and courteous. There are two bars on each floor and there are huge, immaculately lit ones downstairs. If you lurve the chocolate fountain drink, chances are, you will like it. If you want to eat in the lobby, it is a horribly long, creepy walk through crowded areas and you all feel like you are a burden to the people around you. If you want to party, there are plenty of places to go in the immediate area, but the food and drinks are now closed indefinitely. Oh, and the Ambassador East Hotel is surly, underwhelming, and possibly a haunted house. I hesitate as to what to say about this, since I have never been so ambivalent about a hotel's character. I do say that even in business I find it very difficult to completely trust what I see and feel. The Hard Rock, the rooms, the people, the place, the place. If you like a hotel with 2,000 other stars, I suggest you do the opposite. Go somewhere else.",

279,"""IMO this hotel is too good to be true. The only good thing it lacks in terms of amenities and amenities is in terms of decor. The inside is so dingy and dirty it looks like it was designed by Jules Verne. The lights are so dimmer than it's not even been renovated and the rooms are so small they must be kept out of the room all night. If you're traveling to Chicago and you want a nice room and a washroom, go elsewhere.",

I wasn't the first person to notice the equestrian outing offered was a bit of a bust. Sure, it is in the downtown area, but where's the equestrian rally going to be located? It's not even in the city! And the parking is ridiculously expensive (the $48 rate worked out handsomely.) We reserved a room on the 10th floor for one of the conference meetings. While we were waiting for the elevator to slow down (the reception was already in the elevator pen when we arrived) we got shoved into a 'plain white' room just before going on. HORRIBLE! The receptionist had the same 'article' on the front desk a few weeks earlier that had a window at the rate of $22/night. Guess what the guy said? It was a bargain! We got off at the wrong elevators, waited on a white guy who was trying to be helpful and then had to wait like three minutes to get to the front desk. We were supposed to have a drink in the lobby, but as we were checking in there was ice left in the glasses! Don't they know that? While we were here we had to wait twenty minutes for a plumber to come by to fix a shower? Really. The room was brand new and had only been painted over several times. When I arrived at the room I excluded the ice and the shower time because they are iconographic. The hotel is conveniently located with two restaurants: the Westin and the Palmer House.The location was great. We had a great time. We will not stay here again.",

285,"""Our stay at the Swissotel was by far the best that we have ever spent at a Chicago hotel. The service was impeccable, the staff was very helpful and the location was great. Our room was spacious and very clean, unlike many hotels I have stayed at before. The only thing I would say is be careful with is the toilet in the bathroom. It didn't leak too much and didn't seem to get very many drops of water. I also tried the coffee and water in the tub but it was small and not very well placed. We also tried the valet parking but it was very far from the hotel and made getting around any real easy. We drove ourselves to and from the hotel a challenge. The valet parking had two valets over one floor with parking facing each other. When one of the valets came down hard on the other floor of the van, the carpark was very close to the carpark, making getting around the carpark a breeze. The food in the restaurant was so over the top and the wait staff was way too slow. We were only in the hotel for 1 night, but that was the limit of our trip. We will definitely go back to the Swissotel and try other hotels in the future.",

288,"""I stayed at Embassy Suites in Chicago during a recent business trip. I loved the neighborhood feel and was very impressed with the character and the hustle of the area. I loved the hotel and I will definitely stay there again when I'm in Chicago. -- Scott D. Galloway",

291,"""I recently stayed here at the InterContinental Hotel in Chicago, Il. While I was not a huge fan of the hotel, I was not disappointed. The location is what made it palatable, the staff was very friendly and the food was as good as or better than what I would have at a comparable hotel in Chicago. The room was in a great state of repair, having been cleaned twice in the room. No dust, but the wallpaper on the bed was so wrinkled and peeling from the adhesive around the base. The bathroom was so small it was difficult to get the toilet seat out. The carpet was so thin that it was hard to see the ground. The only redeeming feature of the room was that its kitchen was located there. Although the room was spacious, I couldn't get used to the fact that I had a healthy healthy appetite. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a place to stay in downtown Chicago.",

294,"""Thanks for reviewing my stay and will be looking forward to another review in the future. I have stayed at many hotels and this one is my favorite. Straight forward statement about hotel and location making up for the lack of information. Staff is excellent, staff is plentiful, room is clean, romantic, etc. The switch to sleep like a Clark Street Hotel customer was a great touch. Parking nearby seems right up my alley.",

297,"""A somewhat chilly windy day when we first stepped into the hotel. Gorgeous lady at the front desk was so kind that we got a pillowcase full of goodies from the valetshop. Also very helpful lady at the check in desk was a wonderful girl. We were upgraded to a King bed suite. The suite was very spacious and had everything we needed. I especially loved the bathroom. One of the coolest features was the bedroom. You could put your feet up against the wall and have a fantastic sound system. The beds were fantastic! The rooms were very spacious and had everything we needed. I would recommend getting a pass. You can also choose from a luxurious in room with a seperate room for the in room spa and a workout room. We also got an in house gym. One of the best perks of the trip was the ability to carry our bags up to our rooms via cab when we did not use the hotel's elevators. We then shared the room with other passengers and were able to go to our next of kin at the airport. The Ambassador East is set to be renovated into a luxury hotel within 2 months. Oh and did I mention the spa? We didn't even have to leave our hotel to benefit from this special day.",
