 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was looking forward to a pleasant stay/was mysed when we arrived/but, instead we found a dark room with a TV/Radio on which was a loud commercial for Nordstrom's ice-creams. In addition, I ordered flowers for my wife as a present/service for the bf. Upon calling the front desk, she was told that she would have a say in the outcome. Upon leaving, she stated that she did not take sides in anyway. She sent us to the 'wrong' location - literally the worst spot on the face of a public street - literally the worst street car wash - 25 minutes later, we found our lost and found the damage - bathtub linens, sink cleaner, litter (not even close to what our AFTER dinner reservation was for the room to clean), TV/radio with horn on/on, litter in the hallway (no litter, just nasty wraparound from when you were on the phone with a attendant when you shouldn't be showering) hallwayish, closet with nowhere to put the garbage, dampener, etc. There is a reason we have beds to sleep on - simple as that. Next time we go to Chicago, we will resort to Dunkin Donuts in the lobby.
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to see the Transformers live. I was upgraded to a suite which was bigger than my apartment and covered with a beautiful wallpaper. I walked the five blocks to get to know the rooms and the staff was very friendly, and knowledgeable. I would love to stay here again. 
 
====================
 The Hard Rock Hotel Chicago has become my favorite hotel. I've stayed there at least 5 times now and have never had anything other than a wonderful experience. As you might have guessed - it has a super Rock & Roll theme, with some music paraphanelia in the lobby and on each floor's elevator lobby. The rooms all have large photo murals that are themed to different musicians. You can request being on the floor of your favorite band (like KISS, Aerosmith, etc...) The rooms are GREAT. Well appointed. SUPER Comfortable beds and luxurious sheets and wonderous pillows. The large TV has a cool sound system that ramps up the viewing experience. There's a spacious desk in each room with a mini bar. I've always had a room with big windows and a view down Michigan Ave (the hotel sits right on Michigan - a block from the canal). The bathrooms are furnished with absolutely great fixtures sporting a great design... some of the showers have windows in side of them (you can shower AND enjoy the view down Michigan!) or close the waterproof drapes. I've never had anything but a great experience with the staff here... front desk, doorman, etc are all great. There's a lobby bar that still feels intimate and has nice energy. Big screen TV to catch the latest scores, too. Of course, Rock & Roll music pumps thru the place. You can stay at a 'plain' hotel anywhere... but this is a GREAT, WELL DESIGNED, FUN and MEMORABLE HOTEL that you'll want to return back to. If I had one concern - it would be the rather crazy charge for parking your car overnight. My daily car parking rate was close to $50 per night, which I'm sorry to say is about the going rate in the loop. Stay here. Be cool. 
 
====================
 I have stayed at the James a few times and it has been great. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Aunts, uncles, grandparents, etc. are all great. The room was average at best -notable for the type of hotel. The hotel is right on State Street downtown, a few blocks from the shops at 9/00pm. There was no shortage of people to ask things. The room was comfy and had a few inches (2.5cm x 2.5in). It had a quiet room/study area and a cozy haven from to-go-away day. There was also no shortage of people to ask things as the hotel has a wide entrance, lobby and canteen. The bed was extremely comfortable and the towels were great. I think the best thing about the James is the location. To get there: it is just a 2.5 minute walk to the Red line (BORING) and 2.5 minutes walk to the Red line (WITH BREAKFAST). There: is a off ramp to the Wrigley Building (where you can get a very stiff arm's massage) , a 2 storey brick wall with a big screen TV and a huge patio for shopping. To the left of the Wrigley Building there are 2 restaurants: The Ritz and the Burnham. Both have very nice detectors in the room and if you walk into the Burnham's front door they will put you in a to-go bag for 30 minutes. The Burnham: very nice: online order for 'fitness center' and we had no problem with bed bugs. Our room was very clean and fresh and we had no need for any allergies. The Burnham: we was not in town for 'fitness centre' but for 'business centre'. Heets and robes for 'room.' Overall a nice place with clean beds, very good 'fitness center' experience. We were very tired so we had to take a cab. However, the pub (who made a 'healthy' beer) is open that Saturday. We did not have dinner there so I don't know if it was a consequence of the work load or not but it was nice to have the ability to hear what people are saying on the phone. The hotel is about 10 mins from everything: highway, shopping, everything. We had dinner there, very good. Bar had wine service 1/2 and free wi-fi
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was upgraded to a suite which was bigger than my apartment and certainly more luxurious. It also had a Chinese inspired bathroom. Everything in the room was so dark and quiet. The bed was so uncomfortable you could barely hear anything. The only upside to this was that the shower was small but clean. Everything was in the style including the mini bar which was great if you are working in the morning. I do live in Chicago but do not travel there often. 
 
====================
 I've stayed at this hotel on several occasions and have to say that this one is my favorite. I've had many emails from Tripadie'smen members thanking them for their assistance with finding me a use. This time we found out through online advertisements that the hotel was a home of the Homewood Suites. We are a small hotel but were able to secure a room there through a major advance booking. We had a fantastic experience and would not stay there again. 
 
====================
 I recently stayed at this hotel with my family (10-1 / 10-3). We had a fab view through the speakers. The stay was great. The decor is wonderful. We got a great price and all round great service. I've only had this property at business before and it always ends up being great. It has a great location and is in walking distance to railings, shopping and fantastic breakfast. We paid $90 on Priceline and felt like staying at The James was a fantastic experience. 
 
====================
 I've just returned from a two night stay at the Affinia Chicago and I really can't describe it enough nice things about this hotel. The 'business centre' is gorgeous and there's a martini bar and place to order from the computers in the room. The maid even took our order thru the servers room and if you want a little more control you can open the coveralls around the room. The room was so dark it was very handy for the weekend getaway with the kids. The valet parking was a bit of a pain as we had a credit card on file that was out of date. The room was very clean as well and we had a room on the 10th floor that was not as clean as it was in the past. The valet fees were a bit crazy for the area but were just a bit inappropriate for our price point. I would not stay there again. I would not choose this hotel again. The Negotiation was very impolite and the only thing that came close to working was the Manager's Business Centre's 'pistachio' line. That was a pain to fix and it failed miserably. It's in a good location and the view is excellent. It was very close to multiple attractions including the Art Institute, Marriott, and Millennium Park. If you're into that sort of thing, I wouldn't stay here. The only thing that is tolerable is the expensive, antiquated 'chain smoking' policy.
 
====================
 We stayed at the AE for two nights for a three generation 'girls weekend' (Grandma, mom and daughter). I looked at their website for an idea of rates and looked at any packages that might interest us. Then I called the property directly and was assisted by a very gracious man named Reece. Rates were a bit high for the Saturday night portion of our stay but when I requested the American Girl Package, he was more than happy to honor the advertised rate. The American Girl package was perfect for us. My 8 year old daughter was thrilled. They give you a doll bed, a backpack and a travel kit to keep. They have matching bathrobes for girl and doll (you don't get to keep those). She also got a special welcome letter and a complimentary room service snack from a specially printed menu. Our room, 1334, was large and clean. It had two double beds with nice linens, two chairs, a desk and a clean bathroom. The employees are all very friendly and helpful. We had a drink in the Pump Room but did not eat there. We ate breakfast nearby at a great place called the 3rd Coast. This hotel is north of Michigan Ave. But it is just a short, pleasant walk to the Mag. Mile. I would definately stay here again in Chicago. 
 
====================
 We stayed at this hotel with our two teenage daughters. The doorman, Stephanie and Mona, were wonderful, providing great hair, styling tips and assisting us with packing clothes. The doorman also helped us with packing our bags and arranging our sightseeing excursions. We had a decent view of the city, and could not wait to get out to the great park of Michigan Ave. Our room was very comfortable, with a nice view of the Hancock Building, and very convenient shopping and dining options. We would definitely stay here again. The location is good, close to the action, and close to the place to see the sights. Our waiter Eric was very attentive and had a good wine reception on each floor. A nice upscale restaurant with bar mignon on each floor also had drinks and appetizers in the evening. The hotel was clean and filled with history. The front desk staff was very friendly, and when we requested a room change (which she gladly took) they said it could be had for only $15. We had a wonderful experience, and the hotel staff was so helpfull and helpful. The history of the hotel is told in great detail in Chapter 6 of the Airport Guidebook, so this would have been a great hotel for a visit to Chicago. 
 
====================
 We stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I have stayed at the Homewood Suites more in depth writing and writing reviews , but this is my first and last stay at the Fairmont. I have not had any issues until this time. Before we arrived we went to the Chicago Friinn Club (ountered floor) and their website warned us that our room was not available for an hour. We arrived at the hotel at 1:30 in the afternoon and went to meet our room. When we arrived at the hotel at night there was no room there for us. We went to ask the front desk staff to move us to a 'flat' so that we could have another look at the house. After a 15 minute wait a woman with a phone call replied that she could do no more at the hotel at the end of the day and that she would be calling us back at 'the same time' she would provide the name and house. After this 'situation' we had another 5-10 minute telephone conversation with the desk clerk, who stated that he could not provide a time or place to where we could have known that there was a house. We had already begun our search for a new hotel. At this point the hotel staff made no attempt to find us a other place to stay. We had already hired a preponderance of the evidence line and would have been entitled to a lesser level of security if not for this incident. I would not hold my breath waiting for future reviews of this establishment.
 
====================
 I have stayed at the James a number of times and have stayed at a number of hotels. This is my second stay at this hotel. I have had great results with Hotel Allegro. I have had better nights and the James has been very impressed with rooms and staff. It is a large hotel with 2 double beds. The bed was very comfortable. The bed linens were very comfy. The room was very clean. The location is very central to the city and it is easy to walk to the Magnificient Mile and the Magnificent riverfront. You are walking distance to everything and this made for a very enjoyable stay at the Allegro. There was not one problem at the hotel or in the room. When you exit the hotel lobby you will not be confronted with the usual check and report materials. The hotel has a credit card on the door and when you have called the credit card number the person will give you a $20 gift certificate for a room that is redeemable for cash. The room was very clean and laid out very nicely. The room service was good and the food was good. We had a large bathroom which was well appointed. The housekeeping staff was very helpful and they took care to make our visit easy to understand. We would not hesitate to stay here again. 
 
====================
 We stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I have stayed at the Homewood Suites more in person, but I have stayed at the Four Seasons, Sutton Place, and John Hancock towers. This was my first choice for the desk job at the Chicago Fairmont. I was very pleased with the hotel. I have not had the pleasure of staying downtown as a guest at this hotel before. The interior of the hotel is very nice with views of Michigan Ave and the river. The decor is very clean and modern. The hotel is large and workable. The best thing about the hotel, as others have remarked, is the location. From what I have been told, nothing is set in stone yet - just a corner room with a window and a desk chair. The room I had was on the 11th floor and the room I had was on the 33rd floor. I was surprised to find that the wine list was not listed on the hotel's website, but I was able to get a non-smoking room here. The hotel is convenient to Millenium Park, Michigan Ave, and the Loop. I would definetly stay here again, especially if I are charged for internet access. 
 
====================
 I was very happy with my stay at the Knickerbocker. The room were nice, and the staff was excellent. I was able to stay here for $80 per night thru Priceline. That was an incredible bargain in my opinion .. this hotel is very nice. It has an excellent location ... just off of Michigan Ave. All of the best shopping in Chicago can be found right around the corner. It's a great location ... very close to many great attractions. If there is any negative it would be that there is no swimming pool, but I think that is common with a lot of the older hotels in Chicago, I would definately recommend this place ... hopefully I will be able to stay there again in the future. 
 
====================
 I was attending a conference at the Mariott. They were booked up and I shared a room at the Hard Rock Hotel on the same floor. What a lucky break. This was a 40th floor room with a view of the river. The room was small but cozy. The bed was extremely comfortable. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The room was clean and quiet. I would not hesitate to stay here again. The hotel location is great as there are many great hotels in the area. If I were in Chicago again I would like to stay at the Ambassador East. It is close to all the great restaurants and the beautiful Grace Episcopal Church. The missus was kind enough to hold up a copy of my classic letter and reserve your room there. 
 
====================
 My wife and I stayed for just one night, and loved the hotel. Our first impressions were that the room was very nice and very clean. It was quiet and clean as well. Everything in the room was clean and the bed was great. The second we visited the third time was much better. The staff was more attentive, and more helpful. We had a corner room for a son and his dog. The food was good, and the valet guys said some business. We got the soup and coffee the second night. The fourth and final time we used the gym, and it was really well equipped. The pool and hot tub were also very nice. We had a great view of the city, and saw some beautiful architecture. We would definitely stay there again. 
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was upgraded to a suite. Great view of Navy Pier, lots of signs/cities good but anything to see if there was a boat or two. Check-in was quick and easy. The suite was beautiful. Very spacious. Check out the huge mirror in the room. It was true to the bed and mirror. Looks like there was some sort of levitation device in the room. Check out the flowers in the room. Every kind of fruit, even honey. And even just a pinch of cinnamon is included in the price. The room was very clean, a good size and very comfortable. I was in town for the conference and I have to say the service was great. I have been to Chicago a,knots, restaurants, bars, the hancock tower, the theater, the mall and the waterfront all have great experiences there. Great martinis at Zest and fleur de sel.

The location is great. There is a lot of shopping - which you can pick up at the Pump Room - but I wouldn't go so far to get there. There is also NO CASHABLE MUSEUM in the lobby - which is great if you plan on working at the Pump Room much less the Allegro!</|endoftext|>"
"<|positive|> We booked 2 rooms for 2 nights on Hotwire over Labor Day weekend. We arrived at the Hard Rock at around 10:00 a.m., and they were able to give us our rooms early. Hooray! We were on the 5th floor (Beatles theme). The rooms were very comfortable. One of our rooms was on a corner, and had lots of windows. The other was was a bit larger with fewer windows. Not a great view from our side of the hotel, but we didn't pay for a room with a view. The beds and pillows were EXTREMELY comfortable, the bathroom was full of Aveda products, and there was a bathrobe in the closet. The tv/dvd/stereo combo was nice, but we weren't in the room a lot to use it. We were warned by the front desk not to even touch the snacks/drinks as they were weighted and we'd be charged. No problems there. We did not make use of the free fitness center, because the weather was perfect. My husband was able to go for a run through Grant Park along the waterfront instead. He said it was wonderful. We did use the free internet in our rooms. It was 'wired' internet, but my stepdad said that was better for him anyway. The room was a bit dim at night, but we were able to read just fine using the bedside lamps. There was virtually no hall / elevator noise. The location of the Hard Rock is ideal. It is easy to get breakfast at the Corner Bakery, just blocks to either Grant Park, The Art Institute, State Street Shopping, or Michigan Ave. To sum up, there was absolutely NOTHING to complain about. We would be glad to stay here again any
====================
 My husband and I were in the Fairmont Chicago recently for a conference. We stayed in a spacious suite. All amenities were very good. The bed was very comfortable. The room was very clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I recommend this hotel to others visiting the place. 
 
====================
 I travel often for business and this hotel is always excellent. Location is great, close to the L and pretty. Hotel staff is friendly and helpful as well. Room was set up my travel needs. Thanks to Trip Advisor for a great stay.

I would highly recommend this hotel. 
 
====================
 I booked 2 rooms for 2 nights for a first rate price of $200 via Priceline. I was made to feel like a bargain by the reviews on both Trip Advisor and TripAdvisor. I must not have the tast of Oohe. He must not have the bookies, because they told me that after I booked the rooms they would charge me for the 4 night stay. They did this because they thought that if I got tired or anything of the room, I would get tired quickly and they were not careful with the room. I think that is kind of why they don't tell the customers that they have a deal, because they feel it is a good deal. The hotel is in a good location, in a great location, and the rooms are modern and a little on the small side. The only thing is the service and the quality of the beds. He gave me a late checkout and I was able to pick up some of the bed material in the room after I had checked in. That is nice, but I am really not a bed sleeper. I had to call the restaurant and get Milleragra, and it never arrived. The hotel manager was great, he called me at check-in and he got my car, it was 7 days before it was due, and it was even more late at night. I would come back to Chicago with that one. The Conrad Hilton
 
====================
 My wife and I stayed at the James recently and we had a great experience. The hotel as others have mentioned is in an ideal location. It's in a quiet location, yet so close to many neighborhoods that you want to go to. We upgraded to a studio room which was totally worth the additional cost. It didnt have all the midcentury furniture that the website photos have, but it was elegantly appointed, spacious, and as we were on the inside of the building very quiet. The service was amazing. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful, as well as knowledgeable. This was true from the doormen at the front, to people at the desk and the servers in the restaurant. Both Concierges that we dealt with had great suggestions, and were able to understand our style and sensibilities when helping us out. The breakfast at Prime downstairs is among the best I have ever had in a hotel, this goes for the room service as well. Dinner there was good, but not great. I mentioned almost flawless, as there was a situation that occurred involving the Spa in the hotel. It involved scheduling and was aggravating, as the hotel actively encourages its use. However, Caroline who is one of the hotel managers did an amazingly competent job of making sure that we were satisfied, following up on progress and was a true pleasure to deal with. The experience could have left a very bad taste in my mouth but was resolved quickly. Overall, we left extremely satisfied with our stay and look forward to many future visits. 
 
====================
 My wife and I stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel for the first 3 days of our honeymoon in mid-October. We decided to split our honeymoon up and stay in two different hotels so that we could experience different aspects and areas of Chicago in a week. I will try my best to be as brief as possible - Monthly - I will start by saying that this was the best hotel stay I have had in more than a dozen business trips to Chicago. I had friends over to the The Hard Rock Hotel and they greeted us like we were the family. The staff was friendly, the room was large and clean, and the location was near the bus stop(near the train stop) for business. We had tourists over several days for dinner and we always remember this when we think back on our visits. The Hard Rock Hotel is great for downtown Chicago if you want to stay in the heart of the North Michigan River and you can walk to both sights and the sounds of the city. The Hard Rock Hotel is also great for getting around if you don't drive. I definitely recommend this hotel. 
 
====================
 I arrived here at about 8pm after a flight from California. I had just called in to let me know that 3 nights prior to my arrival they had a robbery going on at the Hard Rock Hotel. Three teens got into a taxi and took $91 from my room. The taxi driver had the teens carded up and told the others not to go outside during the night. The cab drove them to a party at the Hard Rock that night. Seven people showed up at the party. Two of the teens were charged with battery on a law enforcement officer and given years in prison. The other three have not been placed in the guests cell. This is a very, very comfortable hotel. for the price it is comfortable. the hotel is in a good location with good service (by far the best service I have ever experienced in a hotel) and a great location (about two blocks from the Magnificent Mile and two blocks from the Art Institute) . The line at the front desk was very short, however, so that was that. The staff was friendly and gave us lots to do in the morning and then went out for the day. The rooms were spacious and well decorated, the woodwork comfortable, the bed extremely comfortable and well appointed. The main drawbacks were the internet connection (no microSD card slot), great reviews, and the fact that it was only $9.99/day. (This was the Hard Rock, not the Internet, the guest rooms were small, not what you expect from a hotel like this.) The rooms were also full but not large, about the size of a large martinis parlor. There was also no wifi - so I have no idea if there is a wifi network nearby, though that would be a whole lot of fun. There was also no coffee maker - so I have no idea how Starbucks makes coffee. And the bathroom was small - about a mug or two for a room. We had a room on the 10th floor with a king bed and a queen bathroom, and a queen bathroom was RARE art deco from the 60's. The walls are wallpaper, and the bathroom is mostly covered with wallpaper. The wallpaper is either SUPER fresh or has a super strong basis in the 70's. The wallpaper work is very close, and the room was very clean. The location is very convenient, and the location is not bad, but it is not what you are looking for in an historical hotel. We would stay here again, but for the moneyed best option, and certainly not for an no brainer, is the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago. It is indeed very good, and while it is not the nicest hotel in the city, it is still the most comfortable that it is. 
 
====================
 Had a room on the top floor,no problems,very nice rooms,modest bed,very useful items,very|up to date|> <|positive|> My wife and I just spent the Labor Day weekend in the city,amazing! The rooms were exceptional,not as modern as I like the term 'man cave" is there in the clean room(!)and the bed wasvery comfortable.The 'amenities' were free and really gave you that 'I Live In' vibe.The location is good,5 minute walk to Michigan Avenue shopping. 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was looking forward to a chic, modern hotel. I was not convinced that it was for the 'in' crowd - perhaps because it was so close to the places on the website (e.g., Billings Dispatch, Herald Tribune, Star Tribune, The Star-Ledger) - but rather a younger, more chilled crowd that were able to experience some of the traditional hoteling practices and amenities. I appreciated the attention to style which was evident in all the furniture, the bed, the litter in the bin, the hand-me-downs received here, the plumber was very helpful and friendly. Although I had no complaints about the hotel itself, I will return for sure. 
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to see what it has to offer in this area of Chicago. I've had a long time to go to the city but had hoped I would be able to get a late checkout... I was disappointed especially at the Allegro. I visited with my daughter (10), who was also there with me. We arrived on a Sunday night. I don't know if it was a dotted line or a standard 'linenay' range. There was coffee, juice, and hot chocolate in the lobby...until next day when I showed up at my room. I didn't discover who did this service until I showed up at my room. Even with my great-aunt's suggestion, she ended up routingly having with me. A room with two beds? That was a lot of room in one. The carpet was nasty looking...very yellowish brown. The wall-mounted tv/radio was nice but not awesome. With 4K/24/7 support you are in prime position to see some stuff (think Transformers, or something live action-type stuff...you don't get the 24/7 'live' ability). I didn't get the 'movie' ability. What I saw was a room full of hype, with names like 'The Shining,'' 'The Night Manager' and' Drawn Light Theater. Nothing exciting or anything. No live music act or even a movie in the room. Just a blank stare from the dole-wielding doormen. What made my first impressions of the Fairmont hotel was not only the selection of beds, but the fact that you could see the furniture clearly from the wall. That alone was good. What made my third impression even better was the staff. They were polite, competent, willing to find you a job, and help you if you wish to have it done. For the price of the hotel, this was a must-do. What a wonderful location! I would stay there again and at the Fairmont anywhere! 
 
====================
 We stayed at the AE for one night. They have some of the nicest parking attendants I've ever encountered in a hotel. We got into an argument and ran out of parking facilities. The attendant explained to us that there are certain attractions that only certain areas can have certain types of fees. When we requested certain amenities in the area, she told us that there was none that the hotel could possibly have in a venue that liberal. Run down floor, no open baffles! No complimentary shower! Lack of pool in tub. This was upsetting but the staff told us that they did not have the facilities to furnish it and that we were in luck: it was a 15 minute walk to the Rainforest shopping mall. For the price that the hotel charged for it, we were pleasantly surprised. I will return - just need to find out how much money the ATM charges before calling the hotel. (August 7, 2007)
 
====================
 As a Visiting Lecturer at the Institute of Chicago, I have to say that my major research interest in Chicago came to an end when I was only a few halls down from the front desk staff. I asked for regular door-to-door card checking-something I had not before experienced in a non-depression hotel. I had not before encountered cabs in the lobby, the bellman in the fitness center, or the front desk staff at the restaurants you ordered (pretzels, hot chocolate, juice, etc). All of which made our visit to Chicago such a success. So much for prompt service! (I always welcome compliments- I'm so glad you're paying attention to my every move!). To add insult to injury we met so many other guests who were also quite nice and helpful- from people to people, from managers to staff, even from the concierge! It was a great place to stay. I would highly recommend this hotel - it's consistent service, excellent value for money, and world class facilities. 
 
====================
 I was very excited to try The Talbott after reading their reviews on a '4 stars' basis. From the moment I stepped up to the check in I communicated with all staff in a very courteous and courteous manner. My room was ready in under 2 minutes. The bed was extremely comfortable and everything was in order. The elevators were very slow but 'worked" so I may have had a time. The location to the Clark/Lake front elevators was great as I was taking pictures at the time of check out. The room was very spacious and very clean. The bed linens were very comfortable and the bathroom was clean as well. We had one small problem with a burned out lightbulb in the closet -- called the front desk and it was immediately fixed -- the front desk person was nice and willing to help out if we had any more problems. The hotel is located well within walking distance to the Clark/Lake front elevators and there is a hors d'oeuvre every morning at the bar at the hotel when we are on the lake front with our friends. If you are on the business end of the deal -- and I am not insulting -- this hotel is a great choice for families and individuals. The area around the hotel is conducive to sightseeing and shopping. The architectural tour by river -- no trolley but there are plenty of shops and restaurants around within walking distance. Corner store is also convenient. The bar is very good and the food is quite good. The concierge was very friendly and helpful. Overall, a great stay and we would stay here again. 
 
====================
 Wife and husband stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel for over a week and enjoyed. The room was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and spacious. Special mention would be due to the location -- 20 mins from the Magnificent Mile and 2 mins from Grant Park. Both times we saw Wicked where we saw the film 3 nights. We also saw BLACK WIDOW, SORCEROUS, AND I want to add jealous of all the good reviews about it. What a great setting for a romantic night out! (We also got complimentary beverages from the bar area when arriving HOME.) The entire staff and staff from check-in to check-out were extremely helpful and friendly. We got a room upgraded with huge view of the river. The room was very clean with (toffee covered) wooden closets, Aveda products in the bathroom, and great heat - just what you expect from a 10 star hotel. I highly recommend this hotel -- truly a '4 star' hotel. 
 
====================
 We arrived for a weekend stay and really enjoyed the hotel. The cocktail hour was so full of people that we could not get in. The second night we went earlier and it was very nice. The staff was friendly and helpful. This was a very nice hotel and we will never stay there again. 
 
====================
 I have stayed at the James a few times and it is excellent. The staff are excellent, very helpful, and the location is perfect. There are plenty of great restaurants and shopping along with beautiful neighborhoods. If there is any downside to the location, it would be that there are a few buildings going up next to the hotel (they just so happen to be on the corner of Michigan and Burnham) but that is not a big issue. If you would like to stay at a lower floor (think of it as a studio) the James offers that option.
 
====================
 My husband and I were in the Fairmont Chicago recently for a conference. We stayed in a spacious suite. All amenities were very good. The beds were very comfortable. I noticed immediately that our room had a slight green light that we could be seen in from the room. We were asked to turn the light to green when we indicated that we were smoking. We were pleasantly surprised that we had no odor. We were asked to turn it off after 10 minutes and then could not discuss our experience. Our final call after a few nights was within walking distance and we had a great time. We would definitely stay here again. 
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was assigned to a 'premium' room. It was spacious, clean, and the staff was excellent. As stated in a follow up post, the Terrace was recently painted over and replaced with a brand new 2 queen. The new carpeting is a nice touch, and the bathroom is nice, well appointed. The carpets are clean and the bathroom shower is one of the best I have never had and I have to thank the front desk staff at the Hilton for a lurid 2 night stay. I was sent a beautiful room with nice bath tub, separate from the reception desk, so I could catch a few bites on the commute. I also got a hard copy on the hard drive, only 1 star at best. This hotel is very large, and rests very comfortably. It also has great views of the city. The mini bars patios are all well appointed and well lit. The hotel is also full of good drinks and good food. The starbucks and $9 coffee were excellent. I do not plan on staying here again, but the Terrace hotels are a good stay. 
 
====================
 We have just returned from a two night stay at the Affinia Chicago and our visit was delightful. Thanks to tripadvisor reviews we were prepared for the major construction work on the facade and entrance..it was a mess. And the hotel restaurant and bar remain incomplete and unavailable. Even parts of the lobby had 'wet paint' stickers. All these things could have made for a disappointing stay. Not so!! Although we arrived very early in the day our suite was ready along with a most warm and gracious greeting from the front desk staff. After just a few minutes we felt like we were 'at home.' The suite on the 25th floor, with a fab view along a wall of windows, was sparkling fresh and clean. The bathroom lighting was outstanding and led to my bride of nearly 50 years saying that it made her look younger...she was right! Everything in and about the room was 'like-new' and very stylish. As a visitor we appreciated the very convenient location just a few steps from the Magnificient Mile and all of its ambiance. Thanks to a dedicated and gracious staff, a fantastic location, and chic decorating elements, this hotel can and will be our future hotel of choice in Chicago. The stay was short..but sweet. 
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was upgraded to a suite. The room was huge. The layout of the room was great. The fact it was a little narrow meant that we often didnt both have nap time. I mean, who wants to sleep on a tiny bed when they have a super room. This was perfect. The breakfast was a must have. It was very much my style! I don't know if it was the style then but everyone was very nice. The maid also went out of their way to make sure that our room was clean and that it was not dirty. I mean, come on! The dirty stuff. The fact it was a little late. My husband was only in his late 30's so we had to get him some drinks. The breakfast was so very good. I would definitely recommend this hotel. 
 
====================
 We stayed at the Hard Rock for one night to do some intense, day-after-Thanksgiving shopping. It really is a great hotel. The rooms are really cool, and come with nice luxurious furments on the walls, but the fact is that meandered through adolescence on the trading floor of the Chicago river, but we were never questioned about our rooms. The staff was wonderful, from housekeeping to concierge and valet. The only downside was that the window seats in the rooms were very small. We would wake up from our bed and wonder what our next move was. Sadly, it was never a possibility due to the construction going on nearby. I would definitely stay here again.
 
====================
 This was a weekend trip for my friends and I. We booked a couple of rooms and asked in advanced for the price to be included in the room price to be able to check in from the airport. The hotel confirmed our request and sent us an early check in time for us to check out. The check in time was not raised to allow us to have an early check out time with the hotel but it was late at night. We called the hotel and they said their auditors had the room sold out, so they could not have the room sold out. They gave us a room ($50.00 - $100.00) and asked if we would upgrade. We gave them the old style chair and coffee table and they told us they never made those type of upgrades again. They also told us that to make things easy for us we would have had to replace the coffee table the coffee table needed to be replaced. I feel this is a good price for the space. The location is good, the room was clean, and it included a valet parking. They did not have valet parking dollars and we only had these in our room. We also had paid for internet access. The rooms should have told us that these were free and that we were done with our internet access. We should have known that the deal was good. We should have known for the price that the room was very nice. Overall, I would not stay with this hotel again.
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was upgraded to a suite. I saw many reviews on Trip Advisor. I was very impressed with the room. The vanity has a nice American flag feather feather bed. You are in control of the thermostat. It is not noisy but it does not cool the room. Also, the staff changed the charge for the suite to a package for the room . It was $45.00 per night change. It did not cost a dime. I do not recommend this deal. The hotel is convenient to Millenium Park (the closing date is being worked out in the planning process) and a number of events (like the Chicago Tribune) take longer than planned. The working assumption was that the hotel would close by the time I got to the hotel, but I think that could get very complicated. The hotel website lists the closing hours, but it is only at 7 a.m. That was not the case for me. The hotel put me in touch with the hotel management who confirmed my arrival time and time was dialed back. I was given a room on the 15th floor with a view of the building across the street. The hotel did not open the door for me, but I was able to get in and close to the conference area. I was very impressed with the lobby. Really. I was able to get by through a series of bad phone calls to the hotel front desk. I was given a choice of breakfast or free cocktails which I thought was very nice. I was also promised a bite to eat at the hotel restaurant around noon which I thought was very nice. I was given a copy of the City Guide to the City and was very impressed with the room. I have not stayed that kind of hotel in a life-size replica of a building. . .but I will if I get a chance in Chicago. The location was great, the staff was friendly, the location was worth every penny. I was very pleased with the clean, modern decorating tradition I adhered to during my stay. . .I see lots of other reviews on this area soon. 
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was upgraded to a suite. The room was spacious. The furniture and bed was top of the line. The staff was friendly and helpful. I was recommended a room on an upper floor which was very nice. The breakfast buffet was great and was served in the hotels huge atrium. I would definately stay here again and would recommend to others. 
 
====================
 My wife and I stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel for the first 3 days of our honeymoon in mid-October. We decided to split our honeymoon up and stay in two different hotels so that we could experience different aspects and areas of Chicago in a week. I'll start out by saying that this was a great experience. At check-in, I indicated that we were on our honeymoon and were upgraded to a suite. The Ambassador East is probably a 10 to 15 minute walk from the North end of the Magnificent Mile. It is also just a 2 or 3 minute walk to a lot of great restaurants and bars on Rush. Our room itself was incredibly spacious and well appointed. Our suite (on the 3rd floor) had two very large closets, a large 'living room' and a large bedroom. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the bathroom was nice enough. If I would have payed full price for this suite, I probably would have given it a rating of 4, but because the staff was so kind and because my wife and I had such a great time here, I decided to give it a five. It is also worth mentioning that the concierge was very helpful. My wife and I decided to eat at The Pump Room restaurant, but we were not very impressed. We found the food and service mediocre. The atmosphere was probably pretty neat when Sinatra used to eat there back in the day, but not anymore. Although we were unimpressed by the Pump Room, the staff were kind enough to seat us in the 'Sinatra Booth' which was back in a corner and enclosed by curtains. That neat experience was really the only redeeming value of our meal here. The Ambassador East is an older hotel, but it is in a charming older neighborhood. The staff's kindness and overall charm of the hotel itself really impressed my wife and me. When we are in Chicago again, we will definitely consider staying at the Ambassador East again. 
 
====================
 I travel often for business and this hotel is frequently used. This is true even across all floors. The lobby is beautiful and high-class service. From the concierge (my name) to the front desk, everyone was friendly and helpful. The rooms are small but cozy. I travel to Chicago quite often and have the same experience with all hotels. Chicago is an expensive city but such a beautiful one. 
 
====================
 My wife and I stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel for a long weekend and our choice of spot in the The James Hotel was not good. Although it is in the heart of the Gold Coast and includes a picturesque location such as the Gibsons are located, well, you get what you pay for. The James was delighted to see that their rooms are spacious and well appointed, but we do not recommend this hotel. While we were at the James we had enjoyed the charming little Italian restaurant Fiori (fiumi), which opened up the 'food' menu to us. Now, let us take a closer look at each hotel's features. The James features an elegant alcove with a wine reception. It is elegant. There is also a spacious bedroom and studio room. We had dinner in the hotel's huge, star-shaped room. The app, while not terrible, is not going to make you want to stay in that room again. The bed is, in my opinion, the most comfortable bed ever. I slept well, and was very close to my baby when I was in the room. The staff are all very nice. My baby was in the room next to me when I arrived at the hotel, and said he was very happy when he saw me looking after him. I think he is very disappointed, considering his AAA price point. I was quite happy when I saw that photo of my wonderful little one. The bed is very comfortable, with the softest sheets and very light comforter. The room is, I would imagine, about the smallest I've ever slept in (unless you are wearing heels, of course). There is, however, a right of way which is not very convenient. There is, however, a left turn on the stairs which, if you are using the valet, would literally slam the door in your eyes. I would not stay here again.
 
====================
 I stayed for 5 nights for a business trip and was very pleased with everything. The hotel is just beautiful and the service was excellent from the doormen to the desk staff. We were upgraded to a suite which was full time, but the down side is that it was very loud room. Food was plentiful, and the wine hour was very good. Check out the stunning pool on the other side of the hotel for a great view. 
 
====================
 I stay at The Talbott a regular stay (at heartthrive offering). We had a king bed with pull out for additional security. The bed is VERY comfortable. The room was very clean with both fireplaces and comforter being standard fare. We had no problems with noise or body language. We were also able to request for the doormen to hear our conversations. Though quiet, the ten minute walk to the Talbott is a walk in slow-motion. We stopped for coffee when we were only a few feet away from the doors on the 10th floor and they were very friendly and willing to give us discount vouchers to help us through our shopping. We got a great rate and would definitely stay there again. 
 
====================
 I recently stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel & Towers, and have to say if I have not had this experience before I am extremely pleased. From the check-in desk to the check-out desk, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. My room was beautiful in the lobby, and the beds were wonderful -- I slept so well. I highly recommend this hotel -- and do plan to stay there again. The Sheraton is located WAY to from the Magnificent Mile (including access to Michigan), and there is a great shopping area beyond. For those who like their downtown 'high street,' I think you can still count on Gourmet Pantry at $16 for morning coffee, $6 for evening tea, and $7 for evening snack. The buffet breakfast was great with their 'gourmet breakfast' charged on a case by case basis. The hotel is conveniently located with restaurants nearby. For those who like their downtown 'high street,' beware: parking in the lot: The sign outside is also a sign of things to come. The location is good, right on the North Michigan Avenue confluence with the Magnificent Mile. Check out the cute bunny ears in the fridge -- we like to have her around! I would highly recommend the Sheraton Chicago Hotel & Towers for its excellent service and attention to detail. 
 
====================
 I have stayed at the James a number of times and have stayed at a number of hotels. This is my second stay at this hotel. The first stay was great for a 'Sunday brunch' The second stay was great for a 'Sunday brunch' and the staff was very helpful. The room was large enough and clean enough for our Saturday and Sunday stay. It was also quiet enough for us to take a nap during the afternoon before heading out again in the evening. We would definitely recommend this hotel. 
 
====================
 We got a spanking deal at this hotel for $99 a night. It's in a good location. Easy walking distance to Michigan Avenue and the Loop. Great gym and pool. The bed is very comfortable. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We had a room which was very comfortable and well appointed. It was also very clean and the staff were very attentive. We were given a room with a view of the river, and given a envelope of crisps and cookies to the desk boy for cookies and cookies again, he went ahead and gobble them. We had a tip and a dollar for every cookie and cookie. Absolutely fantastic service and the true gem of a hotel. 
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was placed on hold for about an hour while we consulted with the Director of Rooms, who delivered a written apology and detailed rationale for my predicament. I was put on hold for about an hour while we consulted with the Director of Rooms while he expressed his thanks for the 'sincerest' service. I was completely disapointed. There are many options for staying in a hotel room in the winter, including The James, The James Dean, The James, The James, The James, or any of the following: The James - The James Dean. 3 stars out of 5. 
====================
<|positive|> I stayed at the Fairmont to see what it had to offer in this area of Chicago. It has to be the best hotel in Chicago. It has exceeded my expectations. My compliments. Even though I was conducting a personal customer service test at the hotel, they gave me a room with two double beds and a King bed. Even though I had no other guests, I called the desk and asked to order food from the bell staff. When I arrived at the hotel, there was food in the fridge for the first two days. When I called to complain, I was told that the bell staff was rude and didn't want to be rude. I told them to make room for a milkman, he was very friendly and friendly. I asked if there was a register with the register and he said that there was. No problem. The next day, I called and asked if there was a register at the register counter. He said that there was. No problem. The next day, I asked at check-in if there was a receipt. He said that there was. No problem. The next day, I asked at check-in if there was a mini-bar with all the snacks provided at the register. He said that it was open at the register only. The next day, he checked out but the mini-bar was gone. He said that the next day they would send it back to the hotel. The next day, they did. The next day, they re-did the mini-bar and again the snacks were not. The next day, they re-did the snacks and office drink and food provided. The next day, they re-did the drinks and food and credit card etc and they again the snacks were not. The next day, they re-did the snacks and credit card etc and again the snacks and debit and credit cards and again the credit card etc and again. All this for 3 days? 3 different people check-in at the same time? 4 people? that is rude!! So, during my normal check-in period, she would not give me my information, even after I had indicated that I was going to the airport? This was then when we learned that the mini-bar was no longer in its original location, along with a few other items. We have since been able to walk to the site from nearby Millenium Park, but before we know it, we have lost our ability to control our phone and are now stuck with a bag of grapes left behind by one of the staff and a bag of grapes left at a Manchester City bus stop on our door. We have had to call, write and fax all over again. We have had to call, write and fax several times in the last few weeks as well. We have had to write and fax several times as well. We have had to write and fax several times as well. We have had to write and fax several times as well. We have
====================
 Used this hotel the first time I was in Chicago. I really can't convey all the excitement and good reviews. I stayed in the Hilton Honors building at the Hyatt in 2010. I must say it was a great location. There was never a time I didn't like parking at 2PM - I usually go first thing in the morning and take the train to get to the Magnificent Mile from Navy Pier. All the staff were wonderful! I will definitely continue to stay here at Navy Pier for future trips. 
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was upgraded to a suite. The second night I was in bed and was not impressed at all. The morning before bed time I woke up to find that the duvet had not been pulled out yet. It then occurred to me that there was snowing and setting and I decided to bed everyone just to be in bed for the Snowboarder's first ever conference. A little while later I was finally able to get checked in. There was not one bit of ice in the room that I requested and it was full promptly. Everyone there was very nice and very professional. I will definitely continue to stay here on business next time I'm in Chicago. It has always been my preference to stay at the Omni and I can't wait to continue staying there in the future. 
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to see what it has to offer in this area of Chicago. My first impressions were that the hotel was well served and very clean. That is very important when visiting this size. Second, there are only two elevators to take you up to the lobby. Third, the bus to the hotel is very slow. I was traveling with a friend and she came to Chicago on a business trip and she came to Chicago on a business shuttle. It was the worst part of our visit and we felt we were treated like we were an inconvenience. We had to take the stairs 3 times to get to the reception area. Our room was not ready for us when we arrived, we had to hold the door all night. It happened to be for a week and we were traveling with a friend and we were very inconvenienced as well. We had to call the restaurant and wait for an hour for them to prepare our room. We also had to wait for an hour (as is normal for Chicago) for them to deliver cold inventory to the hotel. We also had to pay for internet for our friends to experience the experience. For the price they were charging we feel bad for the quality of the room and for the inconvenience.
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was upgraded to a suite upon arrival at the hotel. First rate service! The room and bathroom were excellent. The service was great. The prices were very high for this part of Chicago. I do frequent the fairmont and do not pay so much for these types of hotels. Neither do some friends who live in the hotel. 
 
====================
 I had a great stay at the Sofitel over two nights. The hotel is in a great location in the Gold Coast neighborhood of Chicago. There was not one problem when we arrived. The room was very clean and well appointed. The staff was friendly and helpful. The sofitel was a great hotel. I highly recommend it. 
 
====================
 My wife and I stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel for New Years everes on New Years everes eve. The hotel is in a great location within walking distance to many places to eat, shop, and go out for shopping. The rooms are large and clean. I just would not stay here again. The service was awesome and the staff was great. 
 
====================
 I frequently stay at the James on business and have to say, truly enjoys the hotel. It is a beautiful hotel and wealdi hour to be anywhere in the city. We are looking forward to our anniversary in September. The David is a refit from last year. The staff are pleasant, friendly and attentive. We will be return guests in the future. 
 
====================
 We booked 6 nights at this hotel through an online bid/asket on craigslist. We got a room with a king size bed. The room was nice and clean. The hotel is just beautiful. Every employee we encountered was pleasant and helpful. The hotel is about 10 minutes from many Chicago attractions. The hotel is well within walking distance to shopping and dining on Michigan Ave. 
 
====================
 I haven't stayed all that much with Hyatt and I'm not sure if I will be going back anytime soon. The staff was very friendly and professional and the rooms were wonderful. They were just so cozy. The wife wanted to order juice and a martini (I think they missed a pill) for us after our trip. That's about the only positive I can have is the wine delivered to my room after- it was great. And my wedding night was perfect too as I had a huge bang for my bride's neck. The highlight of the hotel was the bell staff who kept us up at any time by giving us a hand with the door. I'm sure it is a nice hotel but I am not sure I want to stay there again.
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was very excited about the possibility of a Gucci trip. I had not planned on staying here before I booked this hotel. Upon arrival, I immediately felt the Berna as it came with all of the amenities we needed. The bed was very comfortable and the hotel is attached to a gallery which allowed us to see some of the most amazing architecture. The restaurant, bar and lounge also had nods from the company behind the counter. The concierge was great and helped us plan our next day's activities. We ate at the hotel restaurant and drank at the hotel bar. The hotel is large and the beds and linens were very soft. We had a spotless, clean and cozy sleep. We ate at the restaurant twice and the reviews were mixed. The first time was a great experience. This time the service was good and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The servers were plentiful and they always remembered our customers well. This time the food was good and the prices were not out of reason. The second time was a bit better. We got a slightly better experience and drank beer at the hotel. The food was good and the prices were reasonable. We accepted the terms and were placed on hold for a while so we could research the rest of the experience. After that, it was a matter of days until we returned from the restaurant. The customer service was especially good since we were on the first floor and we were not near the traffic. I would say that the stay was very relaxing. The rooms were spacious and the bed was very comfortable. We had excellent views of the city and were able to get a great rate on the hotel's website. We would definitely stay here again. 
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was upgraded to a suite. Very impressive. Only complaint is the long wait to access the lobby. I spoke on the phone with one of the concierges who checked in within minutes of my arrival, which was unacceptable. The lobby is on the 24th floor, and it got pretty busy right when I was showingered - no excuse!
 
====================
 Having stayed at the Intercontinental in Chicago before, I was very familiar with the staff and the ambiance of this hotel. The staff, from doormen to front desk, to concierge, to housekeeping, were wonderful. The rooms were large and clean, and the fact they have a large flat screen TV made the view in our room very comfortable. We were able to check in to about 8PM with a 'yes' vote from the friends who had sent us their credit card for the stay. The hotel is in a good location, near the waterfront and millenium park, shopping and dining. We have stayed here several times already and have encountered all the types of hotels that can do the job. This will be our first time in Chicago and the Conrad does not compare. Its in an area with good shopping and eating and the city is well placed to find the Conrad. 
 
====================
 My husband and I and our 10-year-old daughter eagerly awaited the arrival of Chicago's new Best Western. We eagerly awaited the arrival of our son Ben. We were also very excited to see that our older brother was also there. We had no idea he'd be staying, but we were so pleased we requested a room on our website. He answered our door and showed us how to access the hotel. We immediately knewits only inwediting sodomy and sodomy with a fork in the door. We were so pleased with the accommodations that we asked for only sodomizing the kids in the room with the damn thing. NOT sodomized. We were so pleased with the hotel that we gave it a second try. It worked so well that we decided to try it again a few days later. And this time the staff was so friendly and so nice. We tried to make a fuss about it, but they ignored us and treated us like no problem. We could see clearly he was ill from the surgery, so they put him in a different room a few days later. They fixed our TV, but not the tv. They sent for a cleaner and we got a new one just the same. I am still amazed how nice the staff are. We were able to get by with only one night's rent through TVA. We could easily have had enough and moved on to other places. The hotel lobby was a nightmare. I can't even begin on what a great location this place is! If you're a traveler who likes to walk, bike, and eat food right in the heart of the city, this is a great hotel! If you like to eat in the quiet of the Chicago River, this is a great place. If you like to eat in the huge, large, roomy hotel, wow, you have it. But, if you like to stay in the beautiful hotel, hell no. Get a grip. Get dirty with: the firestarter (there are too many on this one)
 
====================
<|positive|> I recently stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel & Towers and had a great experience - certainly one of the best I have had in many years. As most stay one night, I had chosen the Knickerbocker as my next hotel - after reading other reviews, I decided it would be a great place. Like all hotels, the Knickerbocker has had renovations in the hotel and they have done a great job - I'm not sure if everyone was as happy with the view from the hotel bar, but the staff and staff at the hotel are top notch. The room was fluid and well kept - from Ikea to the Starved Saloon. The bath room was tiny and had one shower head, but had a huge selection of hot and refreshing tub drops including an IKEA bath drops are making friends with the other guests, the security is being enhanced by the fact that we are on the phone from Kitty O'Shea's (the decorator) so she knows what is going on around her - and she sends an email out to guests who are not at home to park their PCs. The location is good for downtown Chicago, right on Michigan Ave. Almost everything is within walking distance. The hotel has been converted at the hotel into a boutique hotel - so there is business in the lobby and restaurant - not to mention great food and drink in the restaurant. The hotel staff is very friendly and go out of their way to be helpful. I stayed in a Fairmont Flier and had a fine stay. I have to say that the service was great, the staff was always friendly and the location was convenient. I think there are only 2 types of tickets you get - the other day, I had a question about seated age for the room and the Concierge advised that if you are making the reservation for the first night, reverse the age adjustment and decrease the number of nights you need, and the Concierge would also like to talk to you about that... well, I did not receive a satisfactory response from the Affiliates. In addition, I had inquired about the seating and get a written reply back clearly showing that the previous night, the Concierge had not remembered my request. This is unacceptable to us. We believe that this was a very large ticketed guest entering their room from the 4th night. They did not bring the correct chairs and tables. They said, we can't have these tables brought... we can only have one king size being brought into the room. The carpets have no seat units, the tv is very poor service, and the bathroom is bare. We have stayed at the Omni in Orlando before and did not think that this was a good value. We have never had this problem at any other hotel in the area. If you decide to stay here, speak to a true friend at the check-in desk. We will return you call if we are treated like royalty.

 My husband and I were in the Fairmont Chicago recently for a conference. We stayed in a spacious suite. All the amenities made this a great stay. The first night we had a great view of the Masonic Lodge Building. After that we had a great view of the Magnificient Mile. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant, we just called the restaurant and they served the 'Binnies' - ham, milk, and yogurt. It was great! The first night we had a craving for deep dish menus and were able to eat one in the dining room for $9.99 per person. The dinner menu is pretty good as is the mini pizzas. The decorations are pretty outstanding as is the croissant and rye. The blueberry muffins were a wonderful bowl of cold cereal. We love the Cadillac in downtown Chicago. It is a great place to hang around or wait for someone. We love the river and wonder why no one shows up at night. 
 
====================
 We have just returned from 2 nights at the Ambassador East, and I look forward to staying there again. While not a '4 star' hotel, the quality of the hotel is spectacular. An excellent choice for downtown Chicago, or for Valentine's Day. We were warned by one of the staff members that our room was not a 'Star Room' - it was a small room with a drawl closer to a bed. While the view is of the building, door to door, door you guessed it - the hotel is a great place to stay. May I return if I don't think I'm in a position to bebroach' someone who I know and love. Thanks to a fabulous executive chef, Jared Leto, for a delicious and enjoyable stay. 
 
====================
 We stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I have stayed at the Monaco a few times and it is my home away from home. The rooms are modern and very comfortable. The team from Monaco has been excellent. The concierge was excellent and has recommended many hotels to me. The hotel is just beautiful and the service is very good. 
 
====================
 I booked this hotel for an adult weekend away on priceline and was very pleased with the accommodations and the service. As stated in a previous post, the location can't be beat, but the room was absolutely striking, and the construction next door was so smooth that it was difficult to notice. We had a room that was very large, not quite square, but very comfortable. The location was also fairly quiet, although we did not hear any street noise. The hotel was well appointed, and the beds and linens were quite luxurious. The TV, bed, and linens were also very nice. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone interested in traveling to Chicago. 
 
====================
 We stayed at the AE for two nights for a three generation 'girls weekend' (Grandma, mom and daughter). I looked at their website for an idea of rates and looked at any packages that might interest us. Then I called the property directly and was assisted by a very gracious man named Reece. Rates were a bit high for the Saturday night portion of our stay but when I requested the American Girl Package, he was more than happy to honor the advertised rate. The American Girl package was perfect for us. My 8 year old daughter was thrilled. They give you a doll bed, a backpack and a travel kit to keep. They have matching bathrobes for girl and doll (you don't get to keep those). She also got a special welcome letter and a complimentary room service snack from a specially printed menu. Our room, 1334, was large and clean. It had two double beds with nice linens, two chairs, a desk and a clean bathroom. The employees are all very friendly and helpful. We had a drink in the Pump Room but did not get a view of the fireworks from the 52nd floor. The hotel is in walking distance of the theatres, parks, the river and the river north. There are also free WiFi in the rooms. We had a vet appointment a few weeks in advance and the dog that Mama cared for was a leopard. The hotel is quiet during the Christmas shopping season but not every day. I ate dinner at the hotel restaurant Aria and missed it. The staff are terrific. The manager, Antonio, is exceptionally helpful. Our room was very clean and quiet. The hotel is in a great location on South Michigan Avenue. Two blocks from the Washington Monument and a short walk to the Navy Pier. If you stay at any other hotel in Chicago, please do not stay here.
 
====================
 We booked 2 rooms for 4 nights on Hotwire over Labor Day weekend. We arrived at the Hard Rock at around 10:00 a.m., and they were able to give us our rooms early. Hooray! We were on the 5th floor (Beatles theme). The rooms were very comfortable. One of our rooms was on a corner, and had lots of windows. The other was was a bit larger with fewer windows. Not a great view from our side of the hotel, but we didn't pay for a room with a view. The beds and pillows were EXTREMELY comfortable, the bathroom was full of Aveda products, and there was a bathrobe in the closet. The tv/dvd/stereo combo was nice, but we weren't in the room a lot to use it. We were warned by the front desk not to even touch the snacks/drinks as they were weighted and we'd be charged. No problems there. We did not make use of the free fitness center, because the weather was perfect. My husband was able to go for a run through Grant Park along the waterfront instead. He said it was wonderful. We did use the free internet in our rooms. It was 'wired' internet, but my stepdad said that was better for him anyway. The room was a bit dim at night, but we were able to read just fine using the bedside lamps. There was virtually no hall / elevator noise. The location of the Hard Rock is ideal. It is easy to get breakfast at the Corner Bakery, just blocks to either Grant Park, The Art Institute, State Street Shopping, or Michigan Ave. To sum up, there was absolutely NOTHING to complain about. We would be glad to stay here again any time. 
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was excited about staying at the Omni, but I was pleasantly surprised. No matter what time of year it is, the Omni staff were consistently efficient, courteous and helpful. I was also surprised that none of the staff were pregnant. I was able to successfully have an abortion (opium deficiency) while staying at the Omni. I was able to successfully have an abortion (opium deficiency) while staying at the Omni while on business. I knew I was paying a high price for this Omni. I should have more than paid 569.00 for a bottle of water! I paid 569.00 for a bottle of water! They have a beautiful lobby! 
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to see what it had to offer in this area of Chicago. My first impressions were that the property was very good. Looks of the hotel have always been very nice. Location is excellent for walking around the neighborhood. Reception staff have a good English, fun Sunday style and manners. I would highly recommend the Fairmont. 
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was upgraded to a suite which was bigger than my apartment and certainly more luxurious. The windows to the lobby are huge, my floor has view of the river, and the hotel is centrally located. The beds are comfortable but mine were especially sore from the cold. There is no shortage of people to ask things. For example, was it worth the additional expense of having two parking spaces in the hotel? That was the only thing that went into the decision to keep the van out of the parking garage. Did I deserve the extra space? No. Was it the extra money that was involved? No. Was there a total waste of time? Absolutely not. Was there a set time frame for when the bed would be available? No. Was it the extra money that the vet gave me that was spent on a better sleeping staff? Absolutely not. The front desk staff was very friendly and accommodating. Was very easy to get directions to get as many people as you asked. I was able to get to the hotel by car. The hotel is located near the Art Institute and is a two block walk from the Magnificient Mile. It also is close to shopping attractions, including the one you expect in a hotel of this caliber. I had a great experience and would stay there again. 
 
====================
 We had a great experience at the Conrad. The hotel is very small but not small isn't it? This was our first time coming to the U.S. and we were very impressed. We had no problem paying for room service and the woman who answered the door was wonderful and always friendly. We asked for a bottle of wine for our anniversary dinner and he took care to make us one. We had a room away from the elevators and on the lot next door (20th floor) facing the hotel. A member of staff took a selfie with us (receiving enthusiastic comments 'Nice touch!') The room was very comfortable and the view was great. The starbucks in the lobby was a must. The hotel restaurant and bar area is very cute too. We had a drink in the Pump Room but beware - there's a $7 seat discount. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The 'sung' and 'write on the wall' signs say say so don't take too serious a look at that. The decor is simple but elegant. The bed is very comfortable and the room decor is pretty. We had a great stay and would stay there again. 
 
====================
 I booked a room at the Ritz Carlton and was enticed by the word of a gracious corporate employee. She greeted me on the phone a few mornings as I checked in and she suggested getting a grip on your dresser. No matter what time it was I booked me in for, I knew I'd be taken care of if needed. The location was sublime. Two blocks west of Michigan Ave. Water Tower is easily accessible from the street. Shopping is easy with the help of the nifty red line on the door of the Carlton. 
 
====================
 We stayed at this hotel for a conference. The lobby and the conference areas were immaculate. The restaurants (one of which was Shula's Steakhouse) and bars were great. The saff was exteremely helpful. The rooms left a lot to be desired...Our junior was martyred in the spring of 2004. We do not have a home address. 
 
====================
 We got a great deal on this hotel, just $91 found through travelzoo. We only stayed one night, but were very impressed. The sevice was fantastic from the moment we stepped up to the property. The hotel smelled wonderful and was immaculate. Our room, while not enormous was perfect. We had a great view of the city and lake. The bed was extremely comfortable. We never heard any noise outside of our room. The bathroom was nice sized considering we must have had one of the smaller rooms in the hotel, two could get ready very comfortably. Location was perfect, just off Michigan Ave and steps away from Millenium Park. We would definetly stay here again, especially if we could get this great deal! 
 
====================
 We got a spanking deal at this hotel for $99 a night. It's in a good location. Easy walking distance to Michigan Avenue and the rest of downtown. We walked for blocks well into the night and never felt like we needed a cab. With reviews on Yelp's Rigoberto and on the reviews on TravelZoo's Dalbert, we picked the hotel up. 
 
====================
 We were greeted by the most friendly and helpful bellmen and they delivered us a delicious package which we forgot to thank them for: A great big suitcase full of prepaid debit and credit cards - for which they were very sorry - we were told that we could not check in until 945 but we had to await U.S. Central (p. for bank charges) when we did. A special note - we bring our own coffee and cake one morning after our arrival - it is then!!! Feels like a 5-star hotel!! Staff is very open-minded and takes turns providing suggestions. A little too cozy and we didn't have as many options as we would have liked. I've stayed at this hotel with my family a few times and it always proves to be a great choice for me. In addition, the rooms are small but adequate. Despite its location, the Fairmont Chicago is located very near the waterfront, Michigan Ave and Michigan Ave shopping and eating. If you visit Chicago at $40 a night, $50 and up, the Omni is a great stay. 
 
====================
 Loved this hotel and would definitely stay here again. Location is great, employees are friendly, and staff are excellent. Great for getting togethers and doing things. Helpful Location also helpful and lots to do here: I walked around the neighborhood and saw tons of stuff, including a bunch of shops and restaurants. 
 
====================
 We stayed here as an alternative spot for a weekend on the town for a searing hot summer's at the city. I mean come on it is Tempo - it is! This hotel is it - it is in the gold standard in customer service. I have never had a rude employee this bad. I called down to the front desk to tell them there was an issue with the room and they put my bill down on the desk and they apologized and gave me a new $ for my out of town out of town out of the 9/5 employees that were all there at the hotel. I had to wait in the line to speak to someone again despite the fact that the house keeper who checked me in took care of it for me. The staff were unbelievably helpful. I never waited more than about 10 minutes for anything and even though there were tears in the bathroom, the staff were loyal and helpful. I never had to deal with such attitude in the past. 
 
====================
 We stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. This was fantastic property with hotels all over the city. The lobby was a great place to hang around or wait for someone. The restaurants and the shopping was best. Keep that. Future Traveler's will be selecting between us at home in the future. 
 
====================
 Began with a $7 taxi for 2 nights. Ended up staying with a queen instead, paid $200 and got a wonderful room.Also tried the Monaco for $125 and got a wonderful room instead. Also got the John Hancock Centre as a reservation. But when I got there the hotel was under construction and slow to open to the public. Room was very small and uninviting and very quiet. Restaurants remain open throughout area. For busy days :( Overall a great stay. I would stay here again. 
 
====================
 I brought my daughter downtown for a blowout 'American Girl' Weekend and we were all for it. The girls were pleasantly surprised by the art deco design of the rooms and the fact that they come with their own shower (no need to charge us for the shower!). The art on the walls tells a story - from the turn down at first glance, to the extra blankets and towels that come with the package. The decor is appropriate and the location convenient. The showy quality was very pleasing. Our room had two very large closets arranged in a row behind closed doors. The rooms have large flat screen TV's, and the furnishings are some of the most comfortable I have ever seen. The decor is eclectic and interesting, I would love to stay here again. The location is good, close to the action, and very convenient. The breakfast buffet is great for the town, and is sold out everywhere. 
 
====================
 I have stayed at the Omni many times and have never had this building not be my preferred choice for a room. I reserved a room with a 3000-series hotel based on reviews on TA. I chose the Omni based on its superior service and attention to detail. I chose the Omni because it had a double room with two swimming pools for $69/night. I reported the theft to the hotel and were referred to their security office who did come clean by contacting the business office, visiting guests requesting rooms, and receiving a written apology. This was the first time that I worked at a hotel at this location and the second time that I saw no problem with a guest staying at the first room and staying at the second room with a third room. The security guard was great and he passed my star when I reached for the cover of my travel bill. I was very pleased with the security guard's actions and was able to stay here for several days without being questioned. I also was very pleased with the color TV and the fact that it did not show the wall wallpaper being touched. The room was very clean and spacious, when in use, it was very closet full of items. The cleaning staff could not disinfect the carpet on the floor between my room and the bathroom floor, they could not disinfect my hair after I had dried my toiletries, and they treated me with the same stale and cheap disinfectants as before. I was so disappointed with the quality of this hotel that I did not use it again until I visited again at the Omni on July 6th.
 
====================
 My wife and I stayed here for a weekend in Chicago and extremely pleased with the accommodations and the service. The hotel is just beautiful and if you take the train nicely it makes for easy visits to the spa and the hotel bar. 
 
====================
 I just returned from a stay at this fabulous hotel - the best I have never had and the rate was waived for all rooms if you book in advance. The check-in was quick and Valet was super efficient in finding us a bar and getting us some drinks. This was our first visit to Chicago and we very much look forward to staying there again. 
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was upgraded to a suite which was bigger than my apartment and certainly more luxurious. The lady at the desk must have forgotten I was still waiting for her, or she would have been rude. I thought the standard corporate attitude about greetings and service is low, but this was different. They treated me like I was very, very cheap. They tried to make me feel invisible. Try as I might, I, looking back, couldn't stand it. They tried to make feel any kind that I might not be able to see (big deal when you are paying $220/night). The front desk staff was chilly and unhelpful. We had a room with a king size bed that almost looked like achwitz-like chamber. The window seats were nasty and the bottom linerlight was DISGUSTANT. The elevators were slow and uncomfortable. I cannot wait to go back here again! 
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was upgraded to a suite. The room was very spacious and clean. The wife and staff were very helpful and friendly. I wish we knew how many nights we had. This is a standard suite. The carpets in the bathroom were ok, but the bed was very comfortable. I know Chicago is very construction site, so the rooms were not mopable. We had a river view, but we did not need to be convinced this was ok. The bed was extremely comfortable, but there were no leftover pillows. There is a Starbucks across the street (Michigan) that is on the top floor, but you can walk to any other part of the hotel. The staff was friendly, but not rude. 
 
====================
 Stayed here for 5 days in the first week in January, when hotel was very quiet. Tried to check in and was told they were closed for construction. Came back and was told they were open. Check out website under construction - no sign of hotel. Would come to Chicago several more times to see if the construction was still open. I think they have good sites in the Historic tower (near the Tribune and a rest stop on the Magnificent Mile), but very limited market in the Loop and near beautiful place for tourists. Dated a couple of folks over there and got us tickets. Didn't get to stay all that much with anyone...oved on to the next hotel and there was just an empty lot next door, a long line at the lobby, some people begging entrance staff, some guy trying to impersonate a bellman tried to enter the room and just about everyone just fell to the ground. Ended our stay there and my husband was in the room next door when he see's us into the receptionist and insults him. Told him we were not in the room to use the shower. He then tried to get at our door with mace while we were standing in the door and started to violently beat us. Told him the place was closed at checkout and that we were in the country so we should get the 25 dollar room there. He then tried to enter our room from the 28th floor using the same method but without our noticing. We opened the door and he in ours and told us the room was locked down and that we should get dark about it. He then tried to start the car and pull up again, this time with a different guest. He tried to start it but was stopped by the security person and she just walked away. I feel this is a pretty big deal since there are only 2 of us in this hotel. We were very disappointed with the bed and do not want to stay here.
 
====================
 We stayed at the Ritz Carlton two nights for a special weekend getaway. I have nothing but good to say about this hotel. It is simply fantastic! The staff was so friendly and go out of their way to be helpful. The room was amazing with all the different types of room types you could possibly want. It was huge. The king size bed was requested so the cleaning staff did their best to keep the room clean and tidy. It was also full of papers and receipts. The decor was very modern and was in sync with the decor of the hotel. The location. was great. Our view was looped to a rooftop with a seperate parking lot. Wolves and elk are abundant throughout the year and our $48 fee/night allowance was enough to get us thinking. Not only was the hotel a great place to stay, the dinner and the receptions unique. We had breakfast at their restaurant twice daily. The hotel staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. It was so busy we did not see a single bad behaviour. This was a great place to stay. Andrew, Marios and Eve in particular were the best. They had a wonderful staff and never disappointing. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. 
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. My trip was stopped when I arrived too late to register for the class. I had to wait in the foyer for 25 minutes to check in the room. I was so disappointed in the state of the room that I called down to the front desk only to be told that the room had not been made up yet and would not be made up again. I had to call down to the front desk again and the manager assured me that the room would be made up when I returned. Very very disappointed in this hotel. Has anyone been able to successfully move beyond the 'furniture room' to 'computer desk' for a desk job? What about a small table? A clean room? I would love to stay here again. 
 
====================
 We booked this hotel using points on our credit card. When we arrived, we were immediately greeted by a friendly face. We arrived several hours before check-in. However, they let us check-in early. They also gave us a free room upgrade. The hotel is absolutely stunning! In addition, it is off of State Street. There are many things to do - shopping, dinning, theater. It is also close to public transportation if you would like to go to the United Center or the airport. The hotel also allowed us to have a late check-out at no additional charge. The room was so dark and quiet we slept in. 
 
====================
 My wife and I stayed for just one night, and loved the hotel. The staff was friendly, the room was very clean and clean and provided a great place to indulge our friends and jazz for a good nights sleep. We were upgraded to a suite which we were very comfortable in. It also gave us some space in the theatre to sit and listen to music while listening to theariums playing nearby. The staff was able to extend our session for us in the evening. We would definitely stay here again. A gem in a great spot on Michigan Ave. 
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was upgraded to a suite which was bigger than my apartment and certainly more luxurious. The windows are so dark that the street is dark. You feel like you're in a fraternity house hotel during your stay. I will not recommend this hotel to anyone. The early morning starts and finishes with no regard to room temperature. Drive hour. Restaurants in the area such as Houlihan and Oktoberoff strongly recommend this hotel. You are strongly reminded to get 'inside your bubble' which is a good thing since much of this is likely due to its location. The bar is decent and people go on about their pointless activities despite the fact that they are directly across from the hotel. We had a very enjoyable stay at the Monaco and would not stay there again. 
 
====================
 I plan to stay at the Amalfi for three nights starting Sunday, April 25th. I was excited about the offer I received from Affinia. I was given a room on the 4th floor, 7th floor, cubby ground floor. I was in the room on the 7th floor and was greeted by the look and feel of a modern hotel. The staff was friendly, but not rude. There was mold in the bathroom, stains on the floor in the hall, etc. was just really nice. The area is within walking distance to shopping and sightseeing. If I were in Chicago again on a frequent basis, I would stay here again. 
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was upgraded to a suite. The room was very stylishly, and the desk and bar were very stylish. The service was also very good. The biggest gem is the Jewel restaurant. Good seafood and pickled scallops for breakfast. Then there is the japanese street food which I assume is pulled from a mile drive away. Good quality coffee and juice in the hotel. Finally there is the card-checking service, which is picked up from a mile or two, but not more than a cup. (It was cabs), but not a single drip. This is very good, and reasonable, for a downtown hotel. I would stay here again. 
 
====================
 We stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I have stayed at the Monaco a half marathon/knotless for a treat. The service was wonderful and staff was very friendly. We were upgraded to a King bed which was very comfortable. The breakfast buffet was a bit over the top but was great for the break from the day. I would definitely recommend this hotel.
