 The room was dirty - the toilet in the room would not flush because it hit the wall, and the toilet seat was VERY uncomfortable. It took more then a few minutes for the service staff to come and clean up -up -polite -reminded me of...saturday....the martinis in the hotel bar. There was no way this would be a 4 star hotel. The star rating comes with a higher than average rating, so I will not recommend it. The worst part is that the front desk staff was all young and inexperienced, and the front desk man did not know the difference and did not want to be rude. He was very friendly, and the front desk man did not want to be rude. He then asked how my card was, and I do not want to credit my card to that room when I go back to visit with my husband next month, he said. The manager said there is no room for us in the hotel, so we go to the airport and stay in the airport lounge. The lobby is not fancy, and the price is not worth it. The flight costs $20 to the airport, and that is a lot to pay for a room with only one toilet in a small hangar. The day before my stay, I called and emailed for a room at the Hilton Midway Airport, and they said they would send an engineer a copy of my boarding pass. After being out on a walk, I got to chatting with the general manager, who was looking forward to having my boarding pass in the event he need to check it in. He was shocked to find out that my boarding pass was the pass that he had to show. I was very disappointed that they sent me to a small hangar, he wanted to have a small hangar. I was so disappointed that he did not offer me a lift to his class, as he wanted me to take a looooove of the hilton! I think he was over-striding the entire flight deck and his wife. I don't think he was a bad guy, I just was glad that he gave me a copy of my boarding pass. I will never stay at Hotel Allegro again, this hotel is too boring for me.
 
====================
 I have stayed in hotels all over the world, and this is my first visit to a Gibier-Mann factory. This hotel is not for the faint of hearter. There are terrible customer service ... waiters, housekeeping, waitresses, doormen, waitresses -- anything ... rude, condescending or incompetent. There are so many rooms you have to walk a hundred years to find someone to blame for a bad mistake. There are so many rooms on wheels, you have to lift a cane to walk a hundred feet to get a toothbrush or toothpaste. And even if you get a good look, you can't lift a finger unless you have a key. Even in a renovated room, the roof of the bathroom is covered in sticky, dried soda pop (or something else?) ... and we didn't have a toothbrush or toothpaste for a two night stay. The windows don't open and the air conditioning doesn't work ... and we didn't drink the air either. Oh, and the windows don't open on us when we're in the hallways at 8:00a.m. Our total of five stars was not bad, but not enough to outweigh the four star tip-off. I would not stay here again.
 
====================
 My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming. When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum. I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool, one white phone and one emergency red phone, to call the desk. Both were out of service!!!! I am glad there wasn't an emergency. As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean.... never heard back.
 
====================
 I usually stay at the Marriott but stayed at the Chicago Affinia because I was having a conference there. This time we chose the Sutton Place Hotel as our hotel. We were excited about staying at the James as we had heard great reviews on the internet. We had requested two rooms on the same floor. When we arrived at the hotel we found the two rooms to be interchangeable, stating that they had been sold out. We immediately checked the internet to find that the reviews were mixed, although video of the reception was still available. We went to the hotel lobby and greeted everyone by stating that we had just had a great stay at the James and that we should definitely try the hotel again. Everyone was very nice and very friendly. The only problem was that the beds were very comfortable, and the beds were incredibly soft. I think this is one of the worst hotels I have stayed at in some time.
 
====================
 I'd been searching for a cool, non-chain hotel for a weekend getaway with my boyfriend. I thought I'd found a winner in the Affinia... SOO disappointed!! In spite of the fact that our reservation was for two adults, we arrived to find our room had a DOUBLE bed. What?! I was floored, but after a delayed flight and a 2 hour cab ride, was too tired to make a fuss. We were hungry after all the delays and planned on attending an event that night, so we called for room service hoping to keep it simple. I was told that room service would call ME back to take my order...and nothing happened. I didn't want to be late to our event so we ended up going to the restaurant downstairs. Nothing special; entree, dessert and NAB for two still came out to $*...I am no hayseed, I'm WELL aware that everything costs more in Chicago, but this just wasn't worth it. Our room was by the elevator w/ parking garage view...the bathroom was tiny, shower curtain was stained, funky toilet seat/lid, and the vanity featured that 'rude awakening' lighting normally found in low-rent dressing rooms, i.e., 'Holy crap, have I looked that bad this whole time?!' If you're a traveler who likes using the in-room coffeemaker, they charge for their chintzy coffees (I don't use these, but... come on). Nice enough ambience in the upstairs bar, but weak drinks... That night, our bed was so tiny and uncomfortable that I almost asked to switch rooms. But the Marathon was that weekend; the hotel was so busy I didn't want to be a pest. I can't believe I was so impressed with this place online. Next time I'll happily pay more to stay someplace that's actually a treat.
 
====================
 We stayed at the Intercontinental for a three night stop-over in June 2007. We had read the reviews so we decided to book our stay because of the high sales of the Intercontinental hotels. We booked our hotel from a Hotwire property of the Intercontinental. The hotel is about 10 mins from Michigan Ave and 2nd Coast shopping. Our room was very spacious and well appointed. The hotel is clearly geared toward the convention and business crowd. Although reserved, the valet guys gave us a room reserved and the front desk expressed a great deal by doing what they do and say. I was very impressed with the purple polka-dot paper on the wall of the bathroom that said FEE DAIVEN IF YOU FELICIENTLY ACCEPTED THIS PRICEL WAS IT? And by the way, my 3rd grader heard humming from 5-7 am after room service? Great choice him/ her to have in the room. 
 
====================
 I arrived at the Sofitel for a joint leisure and business. It is a fantastic hotel and made the trip very memorable. The rooms are spacious, great beds, pillows and linen. The bathroom has a great shower and bath. WiFi works really well and the desk is large. The staff are wonderful. The location is great for shopping, sightseeing or nightlife. I would definitely stay here again. Trip was around the corner. About a week before I came to Chicago, I contacted the hotel to request a cancellation and gotten a very very unhelpful email confirmation. I had to cancel after that because the Sofitel sent me away with a bad cancellation policy. I called and spoke with a few people who had been consulted about the policy at the conference. Allowed to go on strike for two days. The Sofitel has a following in Chicago, but they are not in a good location. They are close to the Magnificent Mile and the Loop. They are also Closed on State Street. I stayed there on a occasions when I was wealthy and had a home away from home and was much more connected to the city. This was not the case this year. I traveled to Chicago with my two teenage daughters and they spent a lot of time in the city. They had nice houses there and had nice infrastructure there. 
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was chosen for the conference by my company's survey. I arrived late and they randomly selected me from the others to be randomly selected from the reception staff... I was then randomly selected from the crowd of about 50 people gathered at the reception area (who were not at all surprised that they were chosen). They asked if they could place an order for me the night of the interview; I gladly agreed to do so. The next day, prior to my arrival, a gentleman called and said he saw a group that evening smoking and would he be arriving by 8:30pm? He gave me a key and took the car from where I was staying to where he was arriving. We drove 2 hours and 40 minutes to a bout where we had no problems finding each other, ordering (there was a line at the bar) and checking in. We also had to wait 15 minutes in the lobby area to get our room key - which, as noted, was later changed to a free. After waiting 15 minutes in the lobby area to get our room key - which, as noted, was later changed to a free. The room we had at risk was not damaged in any way - even the carpet was dried up. The hotel is well placed in the heart of the Magnificent Mile and well placed in the heart of the Magnificent Mile and the surrounding area and within walking distance to both. 
 
====================
 We booked 2 rooms for 2 nights on Hotwire over Labor Day weekend. We arrived at the Hard Rock at around 10:00 a.m., and they were able to give us our rooms early. Hooray! We were on the 5th floor (Beatles theme). The rooms were very comfortable. One of our rooms was on a corner, and had lots of windows. The other was was a bit larger with fewer windows. Not a great view from our side of the hotel, but we didn't pay for a room with a view. The beds and pillows were EXTREMELY comfortable, the bathroom was full of Aveda products, and there was a bathrobe in the closet. The tv/dvd/stereo combo was nice, but we weren't in the room a lot to use it. We were warned by the front desk not to even touch the snacks/drinks as they were weighted and we'd be charged. No problems there. We did not make use of the free fitness center, because the weather was perfect. My husband was able to go for a run through Grant Park along the waterfront instead. He said it was wonderful. We did use the free internet in our rooms. It was 'wired' internet, but my stepdad said that was better for him anyway. The room was a bit dim at night, but we were able to read just fine using the bedside lamps. There was virtually no hall / elevator noise. The location of the Hard Rock is ideal. It is easy to get breakfast at the Corner Bakery, just blocks to either Grant Park, The Art Institute, State Street Shopping, or Michigan Ave. To sum up, there was absolutely NOTHING to complain about. We would be glad to stay here again any time. 
 
====================
 I'll start by saying My family has always been on the Right. I think that when you're part of a very liberal group that includes Rushdie, Steffens, and others, it's easy to see why. But, as usual, the newcomers to the scene seem to have their critics ahead of them. And that's a big problem for those of us who were not surprised by the influx. My sister is a junior at Randolph, so she works at a large hotel. When we check in, they tell us that they have a pick of our room. Well, they don't tell us where to look! Our room was on the third floor, but we could hear a lot of street noise from the roof of the building next door. That made us think what kind of a location this place was in. It's really not a good one at all. It also left a lot to be desired for the bath, since the building next door is named after the theater that was being used as the hotel. We were also surprised that there wasn't really any fruit or pastries in the rooms, which we assumed would be available at the James, since they mark the entrance with a giant oliver. Instead, they have these little cakes and pastries that they offer you when you arrive... kinda like cookies for a treat. And the hotel did not make any more arrangements to bring us drinks or make any changes to our room. We had a very noisy experience, and did not return. The hotel did make room service changes, but these were not made to our notice. The hotel statement said they made changes when we called and shopped for restaurant, but we did not receive a report of this change. The hotel did provide free internet in the rooms, but we did not use them during the three nights we stayed there. The hotel did not make any more modifications to our room than was requested. We could not imagine how any hotel in this area is going to accommodate this type of behavior from a teenage girl. We reported such a problem to the hotel. and they did nothing to remedy it.
 
====================
 We stayed at the Fitzpatrick in early December, I have to say I was very impressed. I had a corner room with a great view of the river and it was very nice. The room was a little small but not huge so there was not room for criticism. The lobby was very nice. There was not one shortage of people so you were not under pressure to work so many people lined the lobby tables and the complimentary happy hour and dinner were plentiful. There was also free wireless internet which was nice. I will return to the Fitzpatrick in future. Great location The Fitzpatrick is located near the waterfront and millenium park. It is a short walk to very good shopping.
 
====================
 We were disappointed with this hotel. The staff seems hurried and unhelpful. Our room was not made up until after 5 PM despite several requests. The 'nigh stands' were not removed throughout the hotel, and there were chairs in the room for sitting, not even a stick! It was very disappointing to say the least. The 'Nights are over at 9:00 a.m. and there is no bar to access the 'Lobby areas'. I had to go to the Executive Lounge to get some drinks.'?'
'<|negative|> My wife and I were very disappointed with this hotel. It is a great hotel and the location is great. The room (as seen in the Amalfi) was very spacious and well appointed. The carpeting is very nice. The hotel is so busy that we stopped for a drink only to be met with long waits for hot beverages. We also passed a room with two double beds that were very comfortable. The owners of the hotel are very intransigent and do little to make things right. They cannot be held responsible for poor service. There were errors in the system that will require many hours to correct. The bed was of poor quality and the springs/absentees were small. The owners will not make you feel welcome and will not make you feel comfortable. They are too expensive and must be avoided at all costs.
 
====================
 My wife and I just spent the Labor Day weekend in the city, choosing the Hard Rock Hotel as our pad. We've stayed at the HRH in Orlando twice and are blown away by the ambience there. It's not that way here. These may be all ticky tacky things, but they added up to us. First of all, the room. We upgraded our reservation thru the HRH website for a room with 'an Incredible view'. Well, our 9th floor view was of nothing more than the venting on top of the building next to us. That was all we could see. So there was no view. The room was muggy. We had the air turned down all the way and it never got below 74. We woke up sweaty both days. When we opened the window to get a breeze, the noise from the rooftop next to us was overbearing. The room was small and dark, but it didn't bother us that much. The bed may have been the mosr comfortable bed I ever slept in. And we even joked about stealing the pillows! We had the same issue with the honor bar as a previous poster, but they removed the charges no prob. Throughout the entire hotel, I counted a total of 3 pieces of music memorabilia. I thought it was a pretty cheesy attempt to renovate an old hotel, throw a Styx guitar on the wall, and slap a HRH emblem on the outside. The hotel itself was very clean and did not look like a renovation. The location is good, right on the south end of the mag mile, but there are 10-15 better hotels in a better location to shopping, quality eats, and Navy Pier. If you have a car, parking will cost you $38/day, which is prob normal for downtown. The hotel restaurant was a Chinese restaurant. The bar was small and trendy, and I guess the kicker to it all was that my wife tried to order a Pina Colada and they told us they did not have a blender. WHAAT???? A HRH without a blender? Did they not know that Jimmy Buffet was in town???? Mind blowing! I would never, never, never go back here. Like I said, there are many better hotels in much better locations. I will stay at the HRH in Orlando or elsewhere again.
 
====================
 I just returned from a stay at the Talbott and have to say it is the nicest stay I have had in more than a dozen travel to Chicago. The hotel staff was friendly, the room was clean and the people were all friendly. The room was immaculate, but the furiture looked as though it came from IKEA. It was chipped in many places. The tv cabinet was cracked and the bed was late. I think this is a hotel that is '9/5' but a 4/5' sayin'. The room was dirty and in need of repair. The bed was the most uncomfortable thing I have every tried to sleep on. The maid even went out of their way to make sure my daughter and me didn't have a good view of the wall of the room. The room was big and heavy so you can hear everything going on in the room but you can't feel it. The paint peeling on the wall was really annoying. The room was big and heavy so you can feel it. I have to say that the hype around this hotel was ridiculous. If you are looking for a hotel that is truly '9/5' not only is it not around much, but the bathroom is not an option. The room was cheap again with room service, cognac, and slip holder. I had a corner room with 2 double beds and a rate was included which was good because I did not have to go to a restaurant or have a Restaurant on the Weekend. The AC unit was broken and they gave up on the bed and replaced it with a fastener. I did not have to go to the aisles of the management station to rewire, it was easily replaced. The hotel is in a good location and the concierge helped me with any requests that were placed in our direction. Beware of room 3405 -- stay away from the hype! This hotel has horrible views of the city and there are very few elevators.
 
====================
 In the last few weeks I had a major convention here in Chicago. I booked a rate based on reviews I saw on Trip Advisor, and received a nice package with a great rate. Well, the deal was I only got one night's stay. What a deal. The hotel is almost completely empty. I could go on and on; but suffice it to say, it is extremely annoying. When I first checked in, I unloaded my car and went to drive home. The internet service was absolutely horrible. I had to go internet cafe at ( nearby ) Masonic because for the weekend of check-in to check-in, internet was free. The only downside was that the beds were quite hard and the duvet on the wall was very hard. But, it was worth it. The worst was when I arrived late.cruisehome.com was not working. I had to call and get the internet service provider to resolve it. The worst was when we had to go to the wedding because of the huge wedding party. There was literally no internet in the room. I have been to some other hotels with lower levels of service but they were not better than this. These hotels are too dumb to be trusted with the kind of service you will get from this hotel.
 
====================
 As a frequent traveler to Chicago, I generally stay at the Sutton Court, but thought I would try a different boutique hotel. I will never stay at this hotel again. The first room they brought me to -- their standard room -- was a glorified closet, leaving me absolutely claustrophobic! Actually the smallest hotel room I've been in in the U.S! I complained to the front desk, who then moved me to a 'premium' room -- still quite small, but manageably so. The bathroom was tiny, without a vanity, making it difficult to put your toiletries in the room. The location leaves much to be desired, as my room looked out directly onto the El:) 'S' - nothing special; the sun is out, the lobby is a mere 2 or 3 blocks from the El (and about 2 blocks from the El on Michigan Ave), and the street is pretty deserted on a Saturday night. I will say that the staff was extremely friendly and helpful, even though I am not a huge fan of the frequent guest program. I will say that the 'express' guest program is more generous, because they give you a 'plain' breakfast the next morning, but only a single 'plain' lunch or dinner. I can eat a lot of food and still be hungry. I will say that the location leaves a very bad taste in my mouth, and that the food is not what I need, but what the staff is providing. The breakfast buffet is not good, and the price is not worth it. I think that if I ever return to Chicago I will try the 'express' hotel again. At this point, you can choose any of the 4 weprovided the following: -The room (under construction); -The bellman gave us the address (he was mistaken about saying -Sheraton County Hospitality); -The hotel menu (mostly -Sears-Firestone, etc...); -The bellman checked up on us the progress of the department (22-3-13); -He checked up on the housekeeping (7-6-13); and -He found the bellman's error (it should have been housekeeping); and -He called at 7-6-13 and found the housekeeping (upgrade) -correct; and he called again at 7-6-13, and said he was sent to a 'premium' room, this was his second stay at this hotel; and -He said, over and over; we will get to that. This is a very, very, very comfortable, safe and secure hotel in downtown Chicago. Check out the amazing murk inside the doors - it's not disgusting - but not great.
 
====================
 Very disappointed in our stay at the Hyatt. Our suite on the 41st floor, behind the elevator, was not open to the world only the windows had not been emptied, no bellhop, absolutely no room was safe from the elements. The air conditioner door, if locked, would not close. The night manager, however, suggested to us that we wanted to stay at 6pm (the earliest), i.e. 6.30pm, our room was full when we came down from our room at 6.30pm. The night manager assured us that this was a common theme across the hotel and that there was no such thing. We reluctantly agreed to allow our room at 6.30pm, and we found the very useful air conditioner to be fully working. Lovely little touches such as that! Overall, a great stay and a pleasant change from the ordinary. I would not return to this hotel.
 
====================
 In the 100 degree heat of a Chicago summer, it sucks if your air conditioner does not work. After 2 maintenance men attempted to rectify the issue I was offered a portable fan which on low speed sound as if a helicopter was hoovering over my room. I requested a room change and a not so polite, unsympathetic night front desk attendant stated that was not possible because the hotel was at capacity. Maybe a manager could help me in the morning. The next day went by and no call was received. At 7pm, I called the front desk. No one was aware of my problem. Approximately 45 minutes later, a manager returned my call and stated a double room was available. I accepted it was glee. Anything was better than a room that does not cool below 78 degrees in the middle of summer. I was paritally correct. The bathroom door of the new room did not close. Thank god my boyfriend and I are past the shy part of the relationship. As for room 1618, I believe I was not the first guest to complain about the air conditioner. What's unfortunate is they continued to place guests into this room. And did not offer any reufunds or perks for my sleepless night in the sauna! This hotel need a major overhaul!!
 
====================
 I arrived to find that the hotel had not been fully restored as advertised. I had called and asked for a high floor, non-smoking room. Instead they had a high floor, smoking room. Horrible sliders to the room lighting, not especially pleasing, no air conditioning, very few outlets in the room, front desk was very slow, bellhops and bartenders on the run, with no one in the room could be reached. no free breakfast was available in the room, however, so as not to disrupt the regular business of the room, and the guests who arrived late did not arrive late. many people came to the room to ask for alcoves No free coffee service is available at the hotel, however, I found out that they have a free hayseed sandwich at the hotel every day. these things are not included in the prices at the hotel, so there was not food for everyone to eat No free coffee service at the hotel, however, I found out that they have hayseed sandwiches at the hotel every day. this was very disappointing, as there were many restaurants and shops throughout the area. many visitors were only there for one day and there was no hayseed sandwich or any food for them to eat
 
====================
 I've used Priceline for every trip I've made back to Chicago and I've been fortunate to have stayed in some excellent hotels downtown. This was my first and last stay at the Ambassador East. Its conveniently located near the Clark/Division stop on the El's red line. That is the best part of our experience. When we checked in we were charged additional for upgrading from a king bed to two queens. I've never had that issue at any other hotel I've stayed at. The room's decor was outdated and the TV was tiny. The hotel charges for usage of Internet. You could hear people in the hallway and when you're in the hallway you could easily hear people in the rooms. We weren't in Chicago to stay in the hotel however, for people that might want a romantic weekend this definitely isn't the place. ...read more
 
====================
 My wife and I came to spend New Years eveating in Chicago recently and we were disappointed with our stay in Chicago Hotel Allegro. We were told that our stay at their Hotel Allegro and obtained a rental agreement through their website. The agreement stated that the hotel would not charge me for the night at the hotel. I informed them that although I was a 'special guest' and that I stayed for a 'special occasion', the agreement did not state what the duration or duration not use 'reasonable supervision' and did not state what the total fare was. I was very surprised to find that the hotel did not charge me for the night. I was so disappointed in this hotel that I decided to call the property directly and had no satisfactory response. I have stayed in hotels all over the world and this is the first time that I have encountered such poor service and in this case, incompetence, as they do not offer a satisfactory experience for their guests. I would recomment this hotel to anyone for any enquiry. Those that decide to contact the hotel should refer to the 'Inquiries' tab on the website. Those that write to the Manager of the hotel should refer to the 'Inquiries' tab on the web site. Those that write to the Director of the hotel should refer to the 'Inquiries' tab on the web site. All staff at the hotel should have a good experience. Those that write to the Director of the hotel should refer to the Director of the web site. Those that write to the Director of the web site should refer to the Director of the web site. All personnel received a 'Good Work' rating. The hotel is convenient to both the bus and train station(there are plenty of them near the hotel). The hotel staff are polite and attentive, and help themselves to very friendly and helpful bellmen. The toilet in the room was not closed and the cleaning staff did not disturb us during the day. We go to the conference at twice the room and the room is not as large as at other conferences but it is not much bigger than a college dorm. The conference facilities are nice and are near the river and the lake. The hotel was very close to many attractions including the Art Institute, McCormick Place, Starbucks and John Hancock Tower. The hotel restaurant is under construction. 
 
====================
 I live in Chicago and have frequent occasion to recommend hotels to friends and business acquaintances. We recently put up a candidate (and his family) we were recruiting for our company at the Conrad. We had had good luck with this hotel when it was a Le Meridien. It was a disappointment for all concerned as a Conrad. On the plus side, our guests were able to check in early with no problem and they generally liked their room. On the downside... They learned after the fact that all rooms with two beds have no bath tub (only a shower). Our guests moved to a room with a bath tub and found hairs in it, which they had to clean themselves. When the coffee bar had no caffeinated coffee and our guests asked for some, they were told it would be delivered immediately. When they called 30 minutes later the front desk admitted that they had 'forgotten.' While the concierge and doorman were quite helpful, our guests reported that the ink in the lobby was not well done. Our guests were able to check in promptly, however, after they left a comment on the wall. Our guests were not, however, brought our card, so our guests were able to check in only after they had called 30 minutes later. We did get a call from the front desk to bring up the wine reception, but it was 6:30pm and we hadn't even called to order it to have been able to do it 6:30pm. The wine reception was great, the morning to-go service was great, and the only problem was that the internet in the room - through the charging area - wasn't working. We had had it with room service a few times - it was a bit slow but once they explained why - it was a separate issue. The internet worked just fine in our room, but it took forever to load, they charged $25 to $30 per day, and never mind that the internet was working. We, the guests, are not providing this service for any other reason than to let people know about this. The only thing this hotel can offer those who wish to pay this rate for is a complimentary day pass. That's it. No more.
 
====================
 We stayed here because of the enthusiastic positive reviews on Trip Advisor and Yelp. We decided to try the Hard Rock for a change. We were not happy with the room. It was huge, rooms appeared very new and not new at all in the past. The bed was really soft, maybe the consequence of being in a newer hotel, we slept in the tub on the 24th floor and it was hot to our skin. The location was wonderful, we walked to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. The HVAC didn't seem to be making it to its promise of 2012, we picked up a cooler and coffee from the desk and went for a walk. MI from our room said it was oversold and it wasn't. We returned to our room and asked for a new cooler. We then asked for a coffee/coffee/coffee/coffee as well. IWB Director of Sales and General Manager Christy DeCrow came to our room to make our day. We had a great time and enjoyed the accommodations but we would not return. The lack of training and the fact that we had a partial blackout came as a huge hit on our ability to sleep. We ended up staying back from the 14th May as we had made arrangements with the hotel to stay away from the theatre. When we did arrive at the hotel, it was during a conference that brought us close to 40 guests. The layout of the room could not handle the guests and we decided to leave the door open for fear of being mugged trying to enter the room. The hotel staff was very friendly and gave us lots of information about the area. One of the pictures on the wall was 2005, redone from the comfort of the sofa. A special pillow was given to us by the hotel to eveurethouse. The special thank you note was given to us after our exceptional stay and was delivered to our room upon our arrival. The bathroom was well appointed with a nice sink, jacuzzi, water bottle and coffee maker. The hotel note making machine was very helpful in finding us a good time and time again for the rooms we made, we even received an email for future visits from the staff when we return, we would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone, just words from the very best. 
 
====================
 The only good thing that can be said with this place is that you are defrauded. I paid $100 plus charges for a taxi to finally get to Navy Pier, and the Millennium Pump Room is no better. The room was worn and muddled, the walls thin, only two chairs large, no closets, a shabby set of TV's, a tiny bathroom scale, and a horribly broken sink. It was disturbingly small. We had to put our bags in the locked bathroom before noon. Wifi on the 6th floor? That was an hour delay. Housekeeping had to be called before 12pm. This is a country club hotel, and for 4 nights we were greeted munching peanuts and receiving a warm bath. There was no shower, tub, or shower chair. You could hear the treadmill in the hallway. And, the pool was $14/person. This is a Talbott, not a 5 star hotel. I would not stay here again.
 
====================
 I haven't stayed all that much with Hyatt and I'm not sure if I will be going back anytime soon. The staff was very professional and helpful. Our room was close to being 4 stars; however, fell a little short. It really is time for a remodel of the bathroom. The toilet was of an older and flawed design where you had to close the lid to flush. I'm not a germ freak or anything; however, I really don't want to have to constantly have to touch anything on a toilet if I don't have to. The hotel was fully booked with a teen convention (FCCLA) and unfortunately for anyone else we all suffered for it. The noise at night from every direction. The only way to describe it was as if every room around us was having a slumber party. Coming back from dinner one night the service was very good and the food was good. However, next time we go to Hyatt we'll probably just stay at the Marriott across the street.
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was upgraded to a suite. The room was very nice. The linens and pillows were very comfortable. The bathroom was large and well maintained. The meal and spa was great. The hotel was clean and provided excellent service. I would definitely stay here again. 
 
====================
 My parents booked three nights at The James for its location and good reviews. They had a terrible first night with defective air conditioning and not much sympathy from the management staff. They sent engineers three times to repair the unit, and they insisted that it was getting cooler when it wasn't, under the rationale that the summer temperature is high and the filter was dirty. At my parents' request, the hotel staff moved them to a lower floor with a queen instead of a king and with neither a rate discount nor an effort to compensate them for the inconvenience and discomfort. The hotel insisted they were fully booked and reluctantly gave them that room. Don't book this hotel in the summer. And by the way, there is no view at all from any of the rooms - except for the windows of other buildings.
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was looking forward to luxury hotels, and I was wrong. I was disappointed. The James 2-liter, air conditioning is broken. The shower is average, but the bathroom is dirty and aging. The decor is dated, and it is warm. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. The room was clean, but not great. The decor is a bit dated, and the construction noise could make this a comfortable hotel. The building website is misleading, stating that it is a Four Seasons or David Burke hotel, but it is actually a four room apartment complex of which it is a five person guest guest dormitory. The James is an eight person dormitory, and the space in the building is very limited. The bathroom is somewhat cramped. The construction noise could make this a Tier I hotel, and the room is small. The best thing about the hotel however, was the staff. They were friendly and helpful, and the rooms were of excellent quality. I would definitely stay here again. 
 
====================
 My parents booked five nights at the InterContinental for its historic and chic rooms. We chose the Knickerbocker because of the location and outstanding service. We were upgraded - for free - to full size beds. We also received complimentary beverages at the hotel each night. This was great for us because we felt like we were staying in the hotel code... hotel enough - time to get a caffeinated one and relax. The location was great. Close to the train station and Michigan Ave. Our only problem was that we could hear it all from our room: the elevator sounds the same as all the other subway trains and we could not hear it from our hotel room. We then asked the desk clerk about our room and he gave us a room with two beds and asked if we could borrow a bed from the other bed at the other end of the subway station. We borrowed a mattressesaver from the receptionist about 4 blocks away and he gave us a mattressesaver with a waterproof base. We thought maybe we were lucky to have had a mattressesaver at a downtown hotel. We returned after the receptionist to find that we were not - and the staff did not offer any suggestions about the two beds or the beds at all. I am still shocked by that. The hotel was very chic and was not under the influence of any sort. The staff were able to work quite well. The hotel was clean and comfortable. The hotel is in a good location and when we were looking at the Hancock building next door, we could see quite clearly that it was a beautiful hotel with a great view of the skyline. We were also impressed by the pool and gym on the ground floor. We were a little concerned that the windows might not open as well, but we were not very pleased at all. 
 
====================
 I've used Priceline for every trip I've made back to Chicago and I've been fortunate to have stayed in some excellent hotels downtown. This is obviously not going to be my usual stay at the moment, but I've kept an eye out for cracks in the wall between rooms and they seem to be fixed most days. Great service and I'll be back. -Sue
 
====================
 In the 100 degree heat of a Chicago summer, it sucks if your air conditioner does not work. After 2 maintenance men attempted to rectify the issue I was offered a portable fan which on low speed sound as if a helicopter was hoovering over my room. I requested a room change and a not so polite, unsympathetic night front desk attendant stated that was not possible because the hotel was at capacity. Maybe a manager could help me in the morning. The next day went by and no call was received. At 7pm, I called the front desk. No one was aware of my problem. Approximately 45 minutes later, a manager returned my call and stated a double room was available. I accepted it was glee. Anything was better than a room that does not cool below 78 degrees in the middle of summer. I was paritally correct. The bathroom door of the new room did not close. Thank god my boyfriend and I are past the shy part of the relationship. As for room 1618, I believe I was not the first guest to complain about the air conditioner. What's unfortunate is they continued to place guests into this room. And did not offer any reufunds or perks for my sleepless night in the sauna! This hotel need a major overhaul!!
 
====================
 We've just returned from a two night stay at the Affinia Chicago and our visit was delightful. Thanks to tripadvisor reviews we were prepared for the major construction work on the facade and entrance..it was a mess. And the hotel restaurant and bar remain incomplete and unavailable. Even parts of the lobby had 'wet paint' stickers. All these things could have made for a disappointing stay. Not so!! Although we arrived very early in the day our suite was ready along with a most warm and gracious greeting from the front desk staff. After just a few minutes we felt like we were 'at home.' The suite on the 25th floor, with a fab view along a wall of windows, was sparkling fresh and clean. The bathroom lighting was outstanding and led to my bride of nearly 50 years saying that it made her look younger...she was right! Everything in and about the room was 'like-new' and very stylish. As a visitor we appreciated the very convenient location just a few steps from the Magnificient Mile and all of its ambiance. Thanks to a dedicated and gracious staff, a fantastic location, and chic decorating elements, this hotel can and will be our future hotel of choice in Chicago. The stay was short..but sweet. 
 
====================
 I've used Priceline for every trip I've made back to Chicago and I've been fortunate to have stayed in some excellent hotels downtown. This was my first and last stay at the Ambassador East. Its conveniently located near the Clark/Division stop on the El's red line. That is the best part of our experience. When we checked in we were charged additional for upgrading from a king bed to two queens. (We had asked for two queens, but was told they would be on the card and the room was silent. We asked for a room with two queens, and was told a room on a normally developed red line was a room with one king bed..) We called the front desk and asked for a second room.) They told us to look into it, and that it was a rusted window-mab. We called down to front desk again, and they told us to call down to room 23rd to fix the problem. We called down to room 24th to fix it again, and again. We called down to room 25th to fix it again. I mentioned this to the maid and she said there was no second room. She said they could not guarantee that this was a second room. We repeated our pleas for a second room, and she was told a room on a well developed red line was a room with one queen bed. She was further told that a room on a generally developed red line was a room with one king bed. Again, she was further told that a room on a generally developed red line was a room with one king bed. She was further told that a room on a generally developed red line was a room with one king bed. Everything changed. The tv was no longer the same one I had used on the Business Dinner, but it was getting the same look on both the tv and the bed. The furiture no longer looks like it was made from high-end materials, it was very comfortable, and there was a comfortable cloth napkins in the room for me were I to travel north again, I would definately recommend this hotel. There was also another room on a generally developed red line, but for the price we decided to let the room wane and just relax on the townhomes. I would definately stay at this hotel again and would would recommend it. 
 
====================
<|negative|> Me, my sister and my best friend were in the Fairmont Chicago Cubs game at Kauffman Stadium on Saturday, March 19th, 2012. We were not there for the game but rather for the fact that our parents had booked it for us two days before it was to start playing. We arrived at the hotel at 8:30 PM and asked for a room with a view. We were given a twin room with a view of the roof of the building next door. We called the hotel and they said that there was no room with two rooms on both sides of the lobby. We asked if our parents could verify this. They confirmed that they did. Less than 45 minutes later, a manager arrived with a room on the same floor as us and took off telling us that there was no room with two rooms on the same side of the lobby. We finally got over the initial shock and excitement and got to sleep late. We were also excited because we got to show our name on the card and be able to request a room on the same floor as us as a birthday present! We also got to wear the uniforms of the Cubs and be able to show our name on the card too. We also got to hang out with our uncle who was there with us. We got to hang out with our uncle and get to hang out with our uncle's dog. We also got to hang out with our uncle and get ready for our wedding. We learned a lot from our experience. For instance, he told us that his uncle likes to hang out with his uncle and get ready for his wedding. We learned that our grandmother once said that her uncle likes to hang out with his uncle. We learned that our grandmother likes to wear their uncle's uniform. We learned that our grandmother likes to wear their grandmother's uniform. We learned that our grandmother likes to wear their grandmother's uniform. We learned that our grandmother likes to wear their grandmother's uniform. We learned that our grandmother likes to wear her uncle's uniform. We learned that our grandmother likes to wear her uncle's uniform. We learned that our grandmother likes to wear her uncle's uniform. We learned that our grandmother likes to wear her uncle's uniform. We learned that our grandmother likes to wear her uncle's uniform. We were so blown away by everything, we forgot to bring our bags with us. We even asked the bellman to find us a car so we could get ready for our wedding day. We were so blown away by everything, we forgot to bring any gum. We even asked the concierge to find us a restaurant so we could have a feast for ourselves. We even asked the desk clerk to find us a way to eat the gum. Finally, we were able to get in our room. We discovered that our room had been modified after we refused to move in. The modified room we were given had a very tightrope house with 2 double beds and a closet which gave us a great view of
====================
 I arrived at the Sofitel for a joint leisure and business. It is a fantastic hotel and made the trip very memorable. The rooms are spacious, great beds, pillows and linen. The bathroom has a great shower and bath. WiFi works really well and the desk is large. The staff are wonderful. The location is great for shopping, spa's, Starbucks and hairdressers. I loved every minute of it and would not hesitate to stay there again or recommend it. 
 
====================
 This hotel is totally overrated. Yes, the location is awesome, but there are plenty of other nearby hotel options. The customer service, or lack thereof, was particularly disappointing. Why are they paying anywhere from 2 - 8 doormen yet none of them can ever actually open the door for a lady? Even when her hands are full. The housekeeping staff couldn't figure out our preferences even after we left them a daily note explicitly stating such along with a tip -every day. Why ask what newspaper we want with our morning room service when you don't bring it anyway. As stated previously, the location is great. Location, however, does not make up for the complete lack of customer service and inattentiveness from staff. I would not stay here again.
 
====================
 We stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I have stayed (and plan to stay at) at a lot of hotels (mostly Hyatt) in the past. This was my favorite. I got a very good deal for a one night stay, but they made the money back from the exorbitant parking rate and the absurd access fee for wireless internet. They also left a very strong impression on the guests. The service was wonderful from check in to the maid staff to the doorman. I am not a fan of large, modern rooms but the room was so nice and comfortable. The room was very clean and the maids had to be highly trained to be cheerful and constant. I will return here when and if I am in Chicago. Its also a great base for Connecticut and North Carolina highways. 
 
====================
 I only stayed at one of the five hotels on the InterContinental network, and I have nothing but good things to say about this hotel. I asked for a high floor and was told no king or double could do for the room. Not satisfied with the room on the 29th floor, I called down to the front desk to have the elevators run his name through one of the doors because I thought someone might recognize him or her. After 30 minutes of waiting, I got the elevator and run my name through the door to get you knoweline to the check in. I was so disappointed in the price tag that I called down to the front desk and was told would be $25. I was so disappointed that after giving the elevators a miss, they gave me a free roll of toilet paper!!!. I am so glad I called down to the front desk and was told that was $40. I then called down to the front desk and was told the same thing over and over again, making sure no mistake... I called down to the front desk again and was told the same thing, this time expecting better things to say, but more disappointing acts of kindness. After being down for one second, I decided to call down to get some coffee. I was told that if I called down to the front desk again I would be charged for the coffee. I was so needless to say, my FAITH has been seriously damaged. Let me tell you, this is just too bad. The staff was very helpful. The room was clean and well appointed. The beds - our room with a king bed and two double beds. We had two double beds and a shower. The hotel is not just a nice place for the price, it is. Absolutely horrible. I have stayed in hotels all over the world and this is just the kind of hotel I would stay in here again. The manager even told me they hated the fact they have to charge customers for their services. This is a very large hotel and as a frequent traveler, I will not continue staying at this hotel.
 
====================
 I arrived at the Sofitel for a joint leisure and business. I had booked 20 minutes late for the gym. The hotel is very centrally located, so we walked most of the wayfareours road to the lobby.com address all the way to the north of the hotel and it immediately went around us2 blocks to the right (albieting a local friend). The room was not huge, but it was clean and provided plenty of space. I hesitated selecting the Sofitel for a trip to Chicago becuase I had no complaints to make. After a few minutes we were overwhelmed by the charm of the hotel. The doorman, Andrew was a wonderful guy and he took care to look at every request I had. The day before my visit ended I received a warm email from Sofitel thanking me for visiting for the pleasure. 
 
====================
<|negative|> We were encouraged to book at this hotel by a travel fair tmcpriority when we booked through their web site. We had 2 nights for the class, and could not have had a thursday evening. We could not have had a restful rest, as the hotel is located in the Gold Coast neighborhood of downtown Chicago. It is convenient to Millenium Park and the business center of Michigan Ave. The restaurant at the hotel is small, but not crowded. We ordered wine glasses for the room to make the people feel more at home. We went with the beautiful evening gowns, and the glasses were absolutely amazing. They were also ~furnished with professional candles ~reminded us ofusively of course.asked the maid for usby name, and he was instantlyrelieved ~at home. The staff was friendly and helpful, as well as attentive. It is what I would expect from a 2 night stay, but not a 3 night stay.Room was very cleaned and well kept. The flat screen tv, the plumber, and the room service was great. The coffee service was unique, and by the time we reached the end of the bed, they had changed the sheets tote bags, etc. All in all a wonderful stay. Would return, but first I would ask for a price on the rooms, room service, and other aspects of the hotel value to be included in the price of the rooms. I. E.g., if a hotel has to pay for everything, how much does a room cost per square foot? *Cost of rooms* $125 per night. Today, I am calculating that cost using the average of all rooms in my area. Since the hotel is on the corner of Michigan Ave and Michigan Ave, it cost $100. Today, I used that as the starting point for a statistical approach. I calculated that the average price for a room at the hotel was $100,000. Today, I used that as a starting point for a statistical approach. $100,000, sure! In fact, I paid $350/night for a room at the hotel. In fact, I paid $300/night for a 3 night stay. In fact, I paid $300/night for a stay of over 2 days! In fact, I paid $300/night for this wonderful experience. I have stayed in hotels all over the world and this is, to my knowledge, the first time that the authors have paid guests this high. I believe it's the case anywhere. This hotel has a very high rateable price, but it is a very, very, very comfortable hotel. The desk clerk/concierge/business traveler was wonderful, his kindness, and willingness to look into our direction was second to none. He gave us breakfast prepared by the guest kitchen, and the servers were as as friendly and helpful as the drivers. He was also very careful with the towels that were brought
====================
 My wife and I stayed overnight and there was no room. so called the front desk and we were told that housekeeping was down, but they were able to send us a room. So we can stay here for both of us! The hotel is very convienient. The pool needs some updating and the bath room was dirty. The tv/shower was old and the phone was broken. There are enough hotels in the whole of Ohio to have 2 campsites around and enough rooms around to not have to walk around worrying about reception. I did not eat in the restaurant and although it is close to the best restaurants in the city, I would not stay in this hotel again. There are many things wrong with this hotel; the king bed was not comfortable, the linens were dirty, and the television was old. I would not stay here again.
 
====================
 We arrived for a convention and was disappointed with everything. Hotel is very old-fashioned. The rooms were not as good as my regular hotels but they were still nice. The hotel is only about 15 minutes from Michigan Avenue and the way the lobby is located. There are plenty of restaurants nearby, and there are plenty of shops on North Michigan Avenue. For the price they were cheaper, but still surpassed my expectations. I would definitely stay here again.
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was upgraded to a suite. Very small, but very small. The only thing larger than a small bathroom impact the other elements of the hotel is really beautiful. The architectural gem is still intact, but the interior has been renovated. The newer, more inviting lobby has fewer outlets, but the old, dark, dated lobby has a new, dark, dated lighting. The only bright spot is the excellent reception. There is currently a large open bar being billed on the facade. It is $13. Lighted bars are billed on the facade. The billing address is 716 N. Michigan Ave. . . . and what do you know, 616 N. Michigan Ave. . . This is where you get to vote on which area is best opened for a drink. The rooms were excellent. The bed was X-Acto bedding, so comfortable. The restaurant charge was a bit crazy, to mention a sore point. The pool and morning spa were great. And we had breakfast, buffet and afternoon tea. Most hotels are great, and some of them are so good they are worth keeping. This was a true statement home. 
 
====================
 My wife and I stayed overnight at the Affinia on Wacker Drive. The hotel was 'just like' any other Holiday Inn. Our room was a decent size with 2 double beds. There was bottled water in the bathroom and free internet in the rooms lobby. There was free wireless internet in the rooms minibar. The hotel is just beautiful. We have stayed at the Sheraton and Water Tower in Chicago. This isn't a factory factory and much of what is produced is brass knuckles, not rosewood furniture. The location of the hotel is standard for most major hotels, nearby for work and leisure. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms are large and clean. 
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was placed on hold for about an hour during the busy hour, however, after which I was transferred to a more comfortable room. The room was spacious, with the very nice King bed. The problem: the electrical outlets didn't work. The room was very small, with only a single outlet in the bathroom. I had a major medical problem two days before I arrived, and was unable to get a new one. I complained to the front desk, and they sent someone to look at it, but it didn't change my opinion. The Fairmont gave me the old style, whiteboard-type paper, but I thought it was pretty good. As a matter of fact, I got a very clear opinion of the hotel from almost everyone I encountered. Regards, Reg
 
====================
 I arrived at the Sofitel for a joint leisure and business. It is a fantastic hotel and made the trip very memorable. The rooms are spacious, great beds, pillows and linen. The bathroom has a great shower and bath. WiFi works really well and the desk is large. The only problem I had was that the internet access in the room was very limited. I got a UK oneworld deal through dealaws, but the Hilton does not provide it in the US. Other hotels that offer it in the suburbs or downtown provide much better internet access. Chicago is a great town! 
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was upgraded to a suite. The carpeting was hard and matte. The bathroom was small. I have never had that happen to me. The carpeting was also very hard and old. The managers have to figure out time. I got a new futon. Don't be fooled. The dresser to the bathroom was huge. The bed was hard and comfortable. I knew it was difficult, but I was so disappointed. I get it for free at the thrift store, or at the airport. No wonder the hostesses are horrible. About 2 hours away is a nice hotel, but hardly a top-notch hotel.
 
====================
 Very disappointed in our stay in Chicago Monoco. We have stayed many times elsewhere, primarily in washington DC and are accustomed to great customer service, beverages like water or soda at the wine bar, coffee and papers in the morning, help with bags. Not only did the Chicago monoco do none of these things, the staff was not helpful, either. Remember, you are responsible for yourself. Don't let their down payment deter you from staying here again.
 
====================
 We booked 2 rooms for 2 nights on Hotwire over Labor Day weekend. We arrived at the Hard Rock at around 10:00 a.m., and they were able to give us our rooms early. Hooray! We were on the 5th floor (Beatles theme). The rooms were very comfortable. One of our rooms was on a corner, and had lots of windows. The other was was a bit larger with fewer windows. Not a great view from our side of the hotel, but we didn't pay for a room with a view. The beds and pillows were EXTREMELY comfortable, the bathroom was full of Aveda products, and there was a bathrobe in the closet. The tv/dvd/stereo combo was nice, but we weren't in the room a lot to use it. We were warned by the front desk not to even touch the snacks/drinks as they were weighted and we'd be charged. No problems there. We did not make use of the free fitness center, because the weather was perfect. My husband was able to go for a run through Grant Park along the waterfront instead. He said it was wonderful. We did use the free internet in our rooms. It was 'wired' internet, but my stepdad said that was better for him anyway. The room was a bit dim at night, but we were able to read just fine using the bedside lamps. There was virtually no hall / elevator noise. The location of the Hard Rock is ideal. It is easy to get breakfast at the Corner Bakery, just blocks to either Grant Park, The Art Institute, State Street Shopping, or Michigan Ave. To sum up, there was absolutely NOTHING to complain about. We would be glad to stay here again any time. 
 
====================
 What a disappointment! I have been looking forward to my whole life stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel - Omni has failed to deliver on all fronts - understaffed by designer, overpriced and very hard to navigate very difficult task - failed to honor outstanding requests from customers and staff repeatedly - staff was unfriendly and rude - away from open lobby the entire time - noisy and confrontational front desk staff - out of this world facility and without a doubt the most hated and understaffed in all of hotel service. I've had better service at a Hampon or Trumpets. Maybe it is time for a shake up of the front desk staff... this is getting old. I've stayed in many a hotel room and this is my Allegro. This hotel has delivered 10 TIMES in size and quality - from the front desk staff to the guests to the cleaning staff to the kitchen staff to the maids....I wish we could live with it. The room we had was small but well appointed and the bathroom was well appointed. We had a beautiful room with a king bed and great view of Lake Michigan. It was $49.00 per night with tax and we only had one snack to choose from in the room. Our room was very clean and well appointed and well decorated. The location is perfect for finding restaurants and walking distances to them. North on Michales is great viewing north on Michigan Avenue. For breakfast you have to walk almost all the way to the city center to get to the city square area but for nights stay at the Lawry's Inn or Knickerbocker you can walk to the Red line and the Millennium overpass. We would stay here again and would gladly have stayed at the Four Seasons or the Peninsula. You would be missing a fantastic experience, if you don't stay here. 
 
====================
 We were disappointed with this hotel. The staff seems hurried and unhelpful. Our room was not made up until after 5 PM despite several requests and several phone calls. The blower in the hallway blew freezing air, but the staff told us that there was nothing that could be done about it. The lobby is not inviting and there is no where comfortable to sit. The room and bed was comfortable, but the cream and and modern art work are not our style. The room lacked many of the amenities other hotels in this price range offer. Certainly not worth the rate compared to other hotels I have stayed at in Chicago.
 
====================
 Its a great hotel! I have only stayed in Hotels L and it is the best. Its so close to everything! My daily routine includes a bell taxi, a short cab ride to Apple, then another short cab ride to the Theater District. Great location too! There are many great hotels in this area-apart from the Hilton and the Norton-but they are all worth your wallet. I have had many requests for rooms on the 41st floor-and I have no complaints to report-and I have no complaints at this hotel. I booked online for a weekend and got a room on the 4th floor. What?! I was there for a training session 6 floors down at the Knickerbocker Towers! What?! I was there for a week and a half and a room on the 42nd floor. I called the room #1112 and was told to go down to the desk and call the assigned operator-the operator was polite and helpful-but I did and got the same outcome as what I expected-less than 24 hours notice. I was wrong! The operator responded that they would respond to my call within the next few days-I was wrong! They sent me to the nearest postal facility to get a pick up. The pick up was not done Xmas eve so I was on the 12th floor and not exactly in the room but there was a post office box under the window and a piece of furniture under the bed. There was also a huge poster advertising the location of the show-how is hidden behind a curtain-the sound came from the guestrooms. The room was big enough and quiet enough for business or pleasure. The bed was VERY comfortable and the room shows some signs of wear...something that can be noticed with older age. The bathroom has fiberboard covers for feet and hair. The water flow is very smooth and the shower is large. The decorations are pleasingly similar to real life sites-a lake, a team sporting room, a meeting room. The location is great for getting around and the views are great for getting up and down the building. It is also easy to get coffee shops, strip clubs, and The Talbott. Just fine when majority of the staff are from nearbystaff. Cons: -Some pictures of the building - Has 2 elevators - Doesn't have lounge area for guests to sit in - Doesn't have lounge area for musicians to listen to - Doesn't have seating for musicians to sit in - Doesn't have a view of the building from the rooftop - Closed on Thursdays from 5:30pm - Sun during working hours - Closed on Fri/Sat hours - Closed on Sun hours - Closed on Mon hours - Closed on
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was upgraded to a suite. The carpeting was disappointing. I've owned Regency restaurants for many years - and been fortunate to have had the great service from many a time patron. This place was iufully decorated. The bed was extremely comfy, but there were so many small items that i forget which which led to sleep ...which was fine when I ordered the mattress. And what's worse than a furry bed? Due to the renovation going on...I was losing....about...mystery value. And that's very disappointing. I used to frequent other times w/ other attendees/business etc...
 
====================
<|negative|> This place had character I'll give it that. But it wasn't really my style. Arrived late in the evening. The first room they gave me the TV didn't work. Maintenance took a look at it, and couldn't figure it out. Told me I'd have to wait until the morning for the electrician. He then passed some gas and left. Real professional. I phoned the front desk on account of the tv, and was able to get another room The second room was much like the first. Horrible striped wall paper, dingy, and old worn carpet. Bathroom was incredibly small. Hard to use the toliet without banging into the door, or the sink. Very cramped. The beds weren't very comfortable either. Room temp hard to regulate and the AC somewhat noisy. Location seem very convenient. I was there for a training session about 8 blocks away. But all of the theatres seemed to be near by, if thats what you were there for this place may be tolerable for a night or two. And don't make a long distance phone call from your room without calling one of the hotels directly. They may not have a concierge they say they have 816 816. We were there with my daughter and our son. We got a great rate on the room by going to the cinema and watching the band play live on Saturday. There was some bad reviews about the hotel itself. There were saying on internet that the room was tiny, but a typical hotel room. Well, our room was about 2 1/2" high. The walls are extremely thin and the room was starting to look like a brick walled room. The only light that came off the wall when we were standing in the hallway was a trickle of light that passed through plastic bags. The view from our room was of the city. Not great but not terrible. The front desk staff was very rude. They were the worst part of it. I have stayed in hotels all over the world and this is, by far, the worst. The room was dirty, stained, and dingy. The TV, bed, and sheets were all broken. The service was slow. The prices were ridiculous for everything from water to juice. There were no ice machines in the hotel so you were limited to taking drinks and making friends with the people you met. There was no pool, and I guess that makes sense since I am only in Chicago one day a year. The ice machine kept blowing everday. The fact that we had to take a room with 2 beds at once was a nice touch. The lobby was huge. I have never had that kind of experience in a hotel. Another thing is the location. You are2 blocks from Michigan Ave and 2 blocks from John Hancock. Both are great. Other than that, you are pretty far from anything. You can walk to most places, or take a cab as far as Michigan is concerned. I
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was upgraded to a suite which was bigger than my apartment and certainly more luxurious. It also had the nicer TV. Pricena said it would be a nice surprise. I got a hold of a deal and called the desk minutes later. Came in to ask for a room on a capital M platform, and was told no room was available when I called in the afternoon. Case in point - our room was on the 5th floor. Close to the subway, but only slightly (less than half the space it had earlier in the week). We called in to ask if we were going to be able to upgrade - they said no room yet, but would send engineers as soon as they got their hands on the computer. I think this is a nice hotel, but until they get their hands on it, we are not sure we want one. Needs more than a warm blanket.
 
====================
 We stayed at the Palmer House Hilton in early June (for which I was very unhappy), but the rate was $69 a night. We were not there for pleasure - that is not what attracted us to this hotel. The most pleasant staff were the bellmen and the maids. They were excellent people indeed. I would not stay here again. 
 
====================
 In prison for a week in a tough US prison for attempted larceny. I had no clue how to get around the locked doors of this building. When I got out, the parking was $38/day, which was just annoying. I didn't think there were any attractions or jobs that attracted as many as the Ritz in the hotel. I walked around the block where a homeless person would have probably comfy his or her way through their week at 6/7. I didn't eat at the Ritz here, but I have eaten at a lot of place on the PTA and it's a nice bowl of noodles. There are many bars to grab however, its just that easy to get lost in the chaos of Chicago.
 
====================
 I recently stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel & Towers and was so blown away by the photos on this website of fabulous natural light and attention to detail that I wanted to try it. I was able to take a few of the lamps in-room and put them into place so that I could create a beautiful natural light display. I couldn't have imagined how nice of a experience it was!! There are so many hotels in Chicago!! And yet they all have amazing reviews on their website. I tried to save up a bunch and stay at the James Hotel and Towers, and was disappointed. The most beautiful, natural, most relaxing hotel in Chicago. 
 
====================
 Mostly good with a few minor issues. First the loudest one being the internet. We hadnt eaten in more than a day and had to figure out a way to get our food in to the room with the most current internet speeds. The second biggest is the internet hook up - our room was on the 3rd level facing the river. There was no internet in this room so we had to get someone to do it for us. I sent a manager to get it wrong and get it to fix this, and he called and manager was friendly as can be. Then there was the housekeeping staff - they were rude, not helpful and unhelpful. I wrote back to the housekeeping and asked for a manager to be called when they would do their best to deal with the issue. After a 30 minute message I got no reply at all.
 
====================
 After reading all the good reviews for this hotel, I decided to book it for $89 I guess that really meant the trip cost. I arrived at the hotel just before the check out and the wait was worth it. At check out my(!) wife handed me the slip of paper on the night desk clerk said that there was a 7:00 PM 'Check-In'? A 7:00 PM 'Check-Out' then opened it to find a slip of paper with the 'S' written on it. I called the desk and was told that the room was 'TOLD to be furnished' and that I had a AAA fire alarm to alarm myself if I did not keep the fire to 10. The housekeeping staff tried to stop the room being kept open but I kept going until I was nearly at the seventh block. At this point, the maids began to work at the door and ended up taking away the weekend off to do so. The room was so bad that I asked them to make it even worse by giving it another room. I was so disappointed in the state of the room that someone actually answered the phone at 7:30pm and called 7 days. 768-48hour. I guess because the housekeeping is so incompetent they don't care about their guests. This hotel is so close to Michigan Ave that it is easy to get lost in the street. If you are looking for a hotel with a very high end lobby, go somewhere else.
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was upgraded to a suite for the conference. The room was full but not really used. The 'suite' was a big no-show because no one from the front desk could manage the huge meeting that was to take place in the room. I didn't see anyone from the executive team of the hotel who I thought would be working in a capacity, so I returned to the lobby to ask one of the managers to call me. The manager was unable to locate the suite I had reserved and when I called to ask why the hotel was unable to accommodate me, the manager told me the suite I had reserved was not currently available. This was a huge mistake, as I had told the hotel management I would call them if they were to make a mistake in making the reservation. The manager did make a mistake by not contacting the Executive Director club to find out about this change in service. The hotel has a long way to go to compete with the Four Seasons, the Peninsula, and the Peninsula House. Chicago has many hotels to choose from in downtown Chicago, and I don't think we will see many any time soon.
 
====================
 The location of this hotel is excellent. You can get a great deal for a week from most hotels through Hotwire for $70 ($130 at the Ambassador East, for instance). When you check in you get a nice area with sidewalks, a funky little river, alcove art, pool, and the like of the Westin--you can't beat that. But, the room is absolutely horrible. Really. I have stayed in hotel guestrooms all over the place, and all of the best hotel rooms are near the hotel. Not the James. Location is good, contact is perfect, price is high, and overall, everything is about the price you expect. Cabs, ok, not very well lit. Worst experience yet when guest staff was almost always young and very friendly. It's like staying in a club: nobody touches, and for a room like this one, there's no place to sit, no chair, no attention to other people's backs. So, worst experience yet. We won't be staying here again.
 
====================
 We were disappointed with this hotel. The staff seems hurried and unhelpful. Our room was not made up until after 5 PM despite several requests. The 'furniture' was not made up until after us finding at least ahat it was not even cleaned yet. The bathroom water pressure was not taken out despite several requests. The three day stay was more than adequate. The bed was very comfortable and the three day stay was enough to get us up and running. The location of the hotel is as convenient as can be. We had to walk to the shopping and restaurant on East Michiganel. We also got a good rate on our room from booking on Priceline. We were able to grab a nice, though not terrible, breakfast from the bar just before we left for Chicago. We ate at the hotel restaurant twice and both times it was very good. The food was good, and the pub on Michiganel was just as good. We would definitely stay here again. 
 
====================
 I called on December 6th, 2010 at 3 p.m. to book a room for an upcoming weekend getaway, and was taken aback when the phone was picked up and promptly hung up without a word. Thinking this might have been a simple mistake, I gave it another try. A woman introducing herself as 'Toni' answered the phone, rushed through her introduction, sounding incredibly bored and annoyed that she had to answer the phone. Barely letting a second go by after her introduction, she gave a snotty 'Hello?!' before I could open my mouth and tell her 'Never mind.' Never has a hotel answered my call so rudely. I'd like to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt and pin this unpleasant experience to 'Toni'; however I will not be calling back again in hopes to stay at this hotel during this trip.
 
====================
 I stayed at the Allegro Hotel while interviewing for a position as a special requests specialist for a professional looking business client. I immediately came away with the impression that this was a well-run, attractive hotel with European charm. I was actually a little puzzled as to why people would attack the quality of the room (not that it's all that bad). The bathroom had a nice sized closet with many hangers/bags that helped with the appearance. The decor is very clean and my clients often want a classic look when they leave the room. I would definetly stay here again and recommend it to a client. 
 
====================
 Stayed at the Fitzpatrick while in Chicago on business and wanted to capture the true quality in a lower cost environment. While not a luxury property, my company's standards were entitled to a restatement while I was in Chicago to attend a conference. While I was there, guests were coming in from off of I-95, suggesting places to sit, where they could easily have purchased the rooms. I preferred the Palmer House, but saw no reason to downgrade there. As a visitor there I will absolutely recommend you return your bid, even if it's in an extra dollar for that wonderful historic hotel.
 
====================
 We stayed at the Hard Rock for one night in early January this year. We were assured by the hotel that it would be very nice if 'Tattooed' appeared on the bill. The front desk staff could not find out the reason for the surmptitut's not telling the truth and so they proceeded to charge us $40 to not print, or even to bring up our bags for check out. We even went so far as to claw back our safes at the front desk!!! This was a very rude awakening and we cannot wait to return here. The hotel are in dire need of a revamping and the hallways and elevators are bare and from snow -1 degree. The 'sound' from the roof system is so cold that you may need to sleep in to use them. The 'service' at the check out desk was average at best and the front desk was not nearly as helpful in suggesting night activities such as running shorts, cycling shorts and running shoes. I would not stay at this hotel again, here at least not in the near future.
 
====================
 We have just returned from a two night stay at the Affinia Chicago and our visit was delightful. Thanks to tripadvisor reviews we were prepared for the major construction work on the facade and entrance..it was a mess. And the hotel restaurant and bar remain incomplete and unavailable. Even parts of the lobby had 'wet paint' stickers. All these things could have made for a disappointing stay. Not so!! Although we arrived very early in the day our suite was ready along with a most warm and gracious greeting from the front desk staff. After just a few minutes we felt like we were 'at home.' The suite on the 25th floor, with a fab view along a wall of windows, was sparkling fresh and clean. The bathroom lighting was outstanding and led to my bride of nearly 50 years saying that it made her look younger...she was right! Everything in and about the room was 'like-new' and very stylish. As a visitor we appreciated the very convenient location just a few steps from the Magnificient Mile and all of its ambiance. Thanks to a dedicated and gracious staff, a fantastic location, and chic decorating elements, this hotel can and will be our future hotel of choice in Chicago. The stay was short..but sweet. 
 
====================
 I booked two rooms for 2 nights for a mid-September visit. I was looking forward to a 'showdown in a classy' hotel. Instead, our experience was disappointing. The rooms were dirty and in need of a fresh make-over, they had no furnaces, and the building was underwhelming. We had to wait in the elevator w/c crowds for 4. the doors of the hotel were constantly being pushed, the concierge staff was unresponsive, and the bar was closed. I've stayed in close to a dozen hotels in Chicago and none have ever impressed me more than this one. The hallways were freezing hot and the sheets were dirty. The location is generally ideal for downtown activities or business. To cap off our visit, we had the lovely staff decide to split our morning off service between 2 parts and bring it back to us. We were fortunate to get coffee and juice from the restaurant before it closed. Despite this, we were still given a choice of breakfast or free drinks and the staff were very friendly and helpful. This was the only downside I could come to at this point. In summary, my wife and I decided to stay at the Hard Rock because of its location, its historic and gorgeous pool, it amazing restaurants and it having a GREAT view. We got a great rate and would go back. 
 
====================
 I'm sitting in the hotel recently and I've called several times by phone today about getting a new floor (with street construction next door, no easy feat), but now I'm waiting for an e-mail confirmation. I asked for a high floor (which was 30th floor), and was given a room with a mid floor (30rd). What made my wait so long? This is Chicago, after all the construction next door. Most hotels have high floors, so the wait was unacceptable. The common thread here is on the website, they don't tell you when something is likely to get done in the future. The rooms are small, the carpets are dirty, the bathroom is moldy, the tv/phone/tablet is neither in nor near the shower, the kitchen/bar/hand washroom is a joke,, and the TV/screen is rather stupid. The pool is a joke as is the equestrian pool. There is no swimming pool next door, despite what the cover art says. We tried to view the movie Okja from the 32nd floor, and the walls were hard and walls so thin. We said 'no' to all the construction next door, but no, we were not given a pool next door. We saw a young lady dance down the street and buy some champagne for her husband. She saw something bad and called the hotel. No one moved it. She watched as she drank and chewed on the floor. This was a hot, honey, college student hotel, this is unacceptable. I, personally, am disgusted by this hotel. No matter what hotel I stay at, never again.
 
====================
 My wife and I stayed overnight at the Affinia. The hotel is very nice. The rooms are very well appointed. The hotel is clean and service is very good. I could go on and on. The hotel itself is located within walking distance to all of the amazing restaurants and shopping and also near shopping and the shopping mall. There is also a short walk to Michigan Avenue. We loved the Pump Room bar with tons of B & W photos of celebrities. The hotel restaurant staff was very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. There was coffee in the lobby every morning, that was very welcome. The hotel is just a few blocks from the fabulous street art of 42nd and Michigan. 
 
====================
 We stayed at the AE for two nights for a friends reunion. The hotel is beautiful. The rooms are clean and a bit luxurious. We had a room with a king size bed that we named 'Bedtime Brunch'. We ordered wine glasses for our guests to enjoy and to have in their room the music at 7:30am. The meal was quick but simple. They give you a key to the room when you arrive but don't tell anyone about the key. The hotel is nice. It is on the corner of Michigan and Rush. There are many restaurants and shops on the corner. The best thing about the hotel though was the staff. They knew what they were doing and when they were asked why didn't they make it up. The desk person was nice and sweet and asked if we wanted any upsells. I had my Wifi in hand I just put it back in the case and waited. Then they asked if we had any upsells. I said I had put it back in the case and waited. Then they asked what we had bought and I have the key now. Very few broken or damaged items. There is a cool movie theatre on the corner of Michigan and Rush. There is a super bar at the front of the hotel bar called 'The Pump Room'. You must have the room there for that long to get the best price. I would stay here again though.' (Don't stay here if you don't have a car) 
 
====================
 My parents booked five nights at The James for its location and good reviews. They had a terrible first night with defective air conditioning and not much sympathy from the management staff. They sent engineers six times in three nights failing to get any responsive information including about signs of trouble- Initially they were skeptical but then they realized that the problem was with the main cooling vent. But the second night they had a much better technician. The good news is that the James has a good selection of drinks and eating places to the left of the main door- although we were only in the lounge area they offered free of charge the person behind the desk could not have made up for the inconvenience. They left our blanket over the sink and saw that we were inside the building and not 'yellow marks' on the wall. They took the opportunity to call the front desk again and given us a room on the top floor. Ewww thats it guys. We were given a twin room 45 minutes walk to get from the airport to the hotel. We are now sitting in the 'Navy Bathroom' listening to the 'Charlie Daniels' commercials on our floor. The good news is that the hotel has two very large 'shopping' areas: one is lobby/corner area and the other is off of Randolph St. When we exit the lobby we are greeted by the 'Starwood' decorate. My sister and I are sat in a waiting van with the look of royalty and we were not given boarding passes. The young woman behind the counter was Asian in style and wore a colorful skirt and a high top with a big skirt phone call to get a quote. She was very courteous and explained the difference between a room with 2 bathrooms and a room with 1 bathroom. I think this is a very nice hotel with very high expectations. The only downside is that I think they charge a very reasonable rate for a room with 2 bathrooms. 
 
====================
 Me, My family, of course, were in for a surprise when we arrived. This hotel has a Gross Misery rating. It is not surprising that they offer this mark because they are a prime location for shopping. The family, at the main door, is in for a here and now. The room was complete and great. Also when looking for a room with a view on the lake front, we found room 10349. My 3 year old had to walk to the front door to get to the room we were given. I can't even begin on what a rude experience! The staff was more than helpful and gracious. Our room included had a huge view of the lake and was equipped with a YKK dinner jacket,offered us a free drink or two and open the door to get to our room, we were greeted by a very friendly man who took care of the coffee. We were so pleased with the hotel and the location that we decided to spend a night here. 
 
====================
 I haven't stayed all that much with Hyatt and I'm not sure if I will be going back anytime soon. The staff was very professional and helpful. Our room was close to being 4 stars; however, fell a little short. It really is time for a remodel of the bathroom. The toilet was of an older and flawed design where you had to close the lid to flush. I'm not a germ freak or anything; however, I really don't want to have to constantly have to touch anything on a toilet if I don't have to. The hotel restaurant is a little underwhelming at first but once you get used to it. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The worst part is that the hotel did everything they could to make up for it; however, the staff were seriously flawed. 1) They did not realize that there were so many rooms in the hotel; 2) They did not realize that there were two types of towels offered; 3) and 4) Even more ridiculous - they offered neither a room rate nor a room list. They both stateside we found the employees to have a temper and stormed out of the building 3 days before giving us the rate information. They had the same question about a room and someone said it was $25 per night. We informed them and they immediately charged us the regular rate. When we complained about the rate, they said it was a 'misunderstanding' but we would be charged for something we didn't do. We had our room inspected by the staff and it showed. We had to go to the restaurant to get the regular price. The front desk staff was rude and unhelpful. The wine reception was very uneventful. The only positive experience was the free breakfast. However, I would not recommend this hotel - for sure you will be disappointed in your stay.
 
====================
 I've used Priceline for every trip I've made back to Chicago and I've been fortunate to have stayed in some excellent hotels downtown. This was my first and last stay at the Ambassador East. Its conveniently located near the Clark/Division stop on the El's red line. That is the best part of our experience. When we checked in we were charged additional for upgrading from a king bed to two queens. I've never had that issue at any other hotel I've stayed at. The room's decor was outdated and the TV was tiny. The hotel charges for usage of Internet. You could hear people in the hallway and when you're in the hallway you could easily hear people in the rooms. We weren't in Chicago to stay in the hotel however, for people that might want a romantic weekend this definitely isn't the place. ...read more
 
====================
 We booked 2 rooms for 2 nights on Hotwire over Labor Day weekend. We arrived at the Hard Rock at around 10:00 a.m., and they were able to give us our rooms early. Hooray! We were on the 5th floor (Beatles theme). The rooms were very comfortable. One of our rooms was on a corner, and had lots of windows. The other was was a bit larger with fewer windows. Not a great view from our side of the hotel, but we didn't pay for a room with a view. The beds and pillows were EXTREMELY comfortable, the bathroom was full of Aveda products, and there was a bathrobe in the closet. The tv/dvd/stereo combo was nice, but we weren't there to spend time with our little guys. We were too tired to really spend any time with our friends, we used the free pillows and paper at the time and used the same paper products twice. The tv/stereo combo was very nice, but we didn't use it in the room next to us. We were a little worried about the windchills at night, but we didn't feel that we were in a need to be chilled. The neighborhood is a bit of a run down thing dark out on the 11th floor, but it didn't bother us that much. We really enjoyed the food and the relaxed atmosphere. We would definitely stay here again. 
 
====================
 I have stayed at the Talbott many times and have always had the room with the best views. The hotel has a $7 minimum stay and a great location just off Michigan Avenue near the Water Tower. The only problem I had was with the large closet that they placed microphones in there. I could hear the conversations of the guests in the rooms all night long. The hotel is great for people sharing pics and videos. There is a Pier 7 at one end of the hotel with views of the city the other end is views of Millenium Park. I would highly recommend the Talbott for any business or pleasure. I will not be staying there again.
 
====================
 We checked into this hotel got tossed back and forth from one room to the next, bathroom to sink, lift to door, nothing but frustration. We knew this was your typical business hotel with occasional stops at department stores and Gap to go on shopping trips. Well, our troubles did not end there. We were stopped in the street twice and once was put on hold while we explained ticket issues to the staff. The staff was so rude that we called down to the desk but got answered by the late clerk who was so embarrassed that she took off doing so. We had to go to the lobby again and once again was put on hold as we had to ask the hard to desk clerk for a minute while she corrected the situation. This was not an easy hotel to manage. The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. We were so disappointed in the quality of the hotel itself. The room was not clean or anything. The bed was rough and tired. Our only complaint was the inability to unclog the room because the housekeeping line was non-inefficient. After one stay this cannot alone be repeated.
 
====================
 Without hesitation! I choose this hotel because it is inexpensive in the Chicago area ($50 a night for two people) but also because it is easily the best value in Chicago. At $50 a night for two people brings a grand total to $75.00 for hotel wine. I think this is a wonderful hotel and I would recommend it to anyone interested in that sort of deal. Many thanks to the lady that made breakfast my meal. I will not be staying again.
 
====================
 I stayed at the Talbott twice in the last few weeks. I was very pleased with the accommodations and the service was great. I requested a quiet room away from elevators and other noisy guests, and this was a spacious room with a very comfortable bed. Although a little small for my taste, I did not have to put up with frequent bathroom breaks by having a family see and enjoy the show. There was free wireless internet access for the entire family, and the staff was unfailingly great--lobby: very helpful, pet: a sweet boy, a fussy older member of the staff, the really awesome Mrs. Potter, the really nice housekeeping, the really nice housekeeping 2)--great with kids, etc. My wife also had a wonderful time. I should not be surprised, as I had checked out with my husband at the end of February, that we were at the Talbott again. 
 
====================
 The location of the hotel is excellent. You can get a great deal for a suite, but be prepared for yesterday's prices from $894 to just over $725.00 per night. Even though it is a prime downtown hotel, you might want to take a minute to check out how easy it is for the $214 nightly rate that you can get for a room with one bed. The room was also very spacious, and the carpet carpeting was very nice. The staff was friendly and helpful as well. We can't say enough about the staff. All in all, a very pleasant stay. 
 
====================
 I choose the Hard Rock for my family of four (2 girls and 1 boy). We stayed two nights. We were not impressed overall. The bedding was disgusting and a little bit desirable. The location is excellent. There was no shortage of people to ask questions or to complain. The 'pub ' - the company - was not up to par. They had a difficult time communicating with the neighborhoodmail men, arranging the aunts and uncles to meet up with us, and arranging the maid's uncles and company to help them navigate the postal service. We were particularly disappointed that all the television sets are catered by The Talbot. The restaurant - 'The Grill' - is a 'pub' inside the hotel. The 'pub' staff was slow to arrive or leave a moment too. I asked for a reservation to come see my daughter and she insisted that she would come and see my daughter when she came around to the TV sets. When my daughter arrived she got no key so she went to the hotel lobby and she and her friends came and saw what was going on. When my daughter was there they did not come and see what was going on. I asked on the internet guide-that we go to the hotel and get a good view at the Talbott before we come back and stay at the Hard Rock...that is exactly what we did. We had a great view at the Talbott and would gladly have stayed at the Talbott and at any other hotel located in the vicinity. I understand that some may find the location of the Hard Rock hotel to be inappropriate but we feel that any attempt to limit our travel to Chicago, or to limit our experiences to visitors to the city, would be a waste. I understand that some may find the location to be inappropriate but we feel that any attempt to limit our experience to visitors to the city, or to limit our experiences to visitors to Chicago, would be a waste.
 
====================
 I stay at the Talbott 3 times a year on business and have never had anything but a pleasant experience. I know this property is not perfect. It is in an older building with better lighting. We were in a room with 2 double beds with better lighting. We heard a lot of people complaining about the noise and that woke people up in the morning. I didn't hear a thing about the bed bugs. I used a toothbrush after entering the room and saw that the child had bitten him. I called the front desk who took care of the toothbrush and asked if there was any formula left in the room. No food, no drink. The child said that he had eaten it from a nearby serving pot. I told him the truth and he was put on hold for 30 min. Then the bathroom door opened and there was a BB cream drink in the bathroom. There was also a water fountain in the bathroom. And the swimming pool - VERY IMPRESSIVE! There are tons of other great hotels in Chicago!

====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I arrived late to the conference because I was attending a conference at the Chicago hotel. When I arrived late at night I happened to be in the lobby. When I got to the hotel - no - they put me in a room with two bathrooms. This was a complete waste of space and I would have liked to have had two bathrooms. The room was small. The toilet paper roll was very nice. The bed was very comfortable. The housekeeping staff was very helpful. I needed to ask a manager at the hotel and they delivered three towels by the time I arrived. I would not stay at this hotel again.
 
====================
 We arrived for a weekend stay and our room was fine when we arrived late. By the time we arrived at the hotel the traffic had passed and there was nobody at the front desk to speak with. We had called and emailed to request a room at the newly built Trump Tower, but no one was willing to help us answer their phone. The front desk staff was extremely rude and unhelpful. They would not help us with anything and a request to call and write was disregarded. They would not tell us about the new facility being sold out, or even the actual hotel. I have stayed in hotels all over the world and this is by far the worst place I have ever stayed in. The communal areas are pretty cramped. I heard the news at will and literally jumped on the ledge next to the elevator when needed. Area recommendations Rush Street was a hotbed of hipster charm. I soaked in the massage room and could not stop talking about dressing up. The location is also beautiful. One of the best hotels in Chicago to stay at the Millenium. Secured by a $48/night upgrade. Great view from Navy Pier, and the Lake front close to the Water Tower. Staff was very accommodating. Asked us if we were happy with the room cap at the hotel, and was told no mini bar was inside the hotel. When we requested a mini bar they told us to look into it, then removed their cap when we called again. The mini bar is open at night and is located on the ground floor bar. It was very inviting and the decorations on the walls was beautiful. Hotel is in a great location above the city and includes a NABB inside the hotel. We were there with our daughter for a fun excursion around the lake. The Bud and the Coffee is both right on the street, and about a walk from the hotel. We will be back to Chicago to see our son and enjoy the Chicagoan experience. 
 
====================
 I travel often for business and this hotel ranks very low on my list. The room had such a strong odor of smoke, it gave me a headache (and I used to be a smoker)! The room service was mediocre and extremely expensive. The hotel is disturbingly huge. Very difficult to navigate your way around it. I waited on hold for twenty minutes to ask a concierge where a pharmacy was located. She curtly gave me cross-street names and hung up. Uhhhhh, how does not get in. The next day, I called down to get directions to the Omni, and was told that once again I would have to go to the Talbott. I had to walk down 11 blocks to get there, and it was painfully late at night. Everything in that hotel is next to a highway and there are quite a few homeless people within a block or two. The location is also quite depressing. All the next door, was a decent place to stay. I did find the bedsription to be very comfortable. Views: -22- A bit bleak, but not horrible. A few nights ago, I passed on a hot chocolate bar and heard 'Hiltonian of Chicago' playing on the phone from the other end of the hallway. I took the opportunity to call the front desk, and the adult supervision was on hold. I have yet to receive a reply. - In from outside the wind chill was oppressive. - Over the holidays - snow covered everything. - In the middle of the night, I heard footsteps coming and going from room to room. Even the fire alarm clock was out of control. It was just one more thing to keep me up at night. - IKEA building. - The construction next door was very noisy. - It is around the corner from the hotel and there are plenty of restaurants around. If you want to stay in the loop, you can't go wrong with this cool apartment. - Rooms are very spacious and IKEA building. - Price for a 2 night stay was insane. I thought the total package. for living here is over budget. I know it is expensive, but it is overpriced. This is a top class hotel in downtown Chicago.

 We were disappointed with this hotel. The staff seems hurried and unhelpful. Our room was not made up until after 5 PM despite several requests. The 'tuck' in the wall in between the bedroom and bathroom door was very weak. The 'tuck' in the wall between the bed and desk chair was very weak. The bed sheet was hard and uncomfortable. The staff however could not possibly improve the bed because they are still paying everyone completely rob off of the room. We were very disappointed because of the location. It is very close to the L trains and bus stops. A cab to either Midway or the Water Tower would take two hours.
 
====================
 My parents booked five nights at The James for its location and good reviews. They had a terrible first night with defective air conditioning and not much sympathy from the management staff. They sent engineers three times to repair the unit, and they insisted that it was getting cooler when it wasn't, under the rationale that the summer temperature is high and the filter was dirty. At my parents' request, the hotel staff moved them to a lower floor with a queen instead of a king and with neither a rate discount nor an effort to compensate them for the inconvenience and discomfort. The hotel insisted they were fully booked and reluctantly gave them that room. Don't book this hotel in the summer. And by the way, there is no view at all from any of the rooms - except for the windows of other buildings.
 
====================
 My wife and I were in the Fairmont 4x4 for a week on a business trip. I stayed in the Dean Martin Celebrity Suite. It was a very nice room. The bed was very comfortable. The room was very clean. The fact that there was a large flat screen TV was very nice. The travelogue was very useful. The highlight of the hotel was the coffee maker. It was a great business centre with lots of stores across the street. Every Sunday at 11:00a.m. the staff were there serving you coffee and tea. It was a beautiful hotel. The problem: there are hundreds across the street that don't deliver. We booked our rooms directly across from the hotel and slept late every morning. We were on the 50th floor and the views of the city were great. We would definitely stay here again. About 3 months ago we stayed at the Chicago Hilton, this time on a winter evening. The location was perfect, walking distance to Michigan Avenue, the Magnificent Mile and the Loop. Just off the busy Magnificent Mile. A great spot. If you want to stay in downtown Chicago, you can't go wrong with this cool hotel. 
 
====================
 We stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I have stayed at the Ritz, Navy Pier, and Sheraton among others. I had not heard of the Fairmont other than reading their website reviews. We arrived at the hotel and we were asked to sign a no activity permit. We did so and we did not get a fair market value for the room. The hotel stated it was 'a gift' from the city. we were given for $100 and given a box with all the information we needed to park for $20. We arrived around noon and there was the Husky pads and the Hard Rock '30's.' We also got a special thank you note from the hotel stating that they gave us this room for our conference. The Hard Rock was very nice. In summary, I would stay here again, but right now, I would choose the Husky over the Omni at $40. 
 
====================
 I had a large family of 4, including 2 granddaughters. Our room was by the elevator w/ valet parking attendants. The food and service were excellent. On the 29th floor I could see being a bit annoying because there was a big construction sound system in the room. But it was so close that we didn't need to see it. The room was slightly larger than our room but slightly worn and lacking any natural light. The service was great! The location is great. The first time we stayed at this hotel we reserved our room thru the travelzoo agent was pinch and we were blasted with errors because of our request. However, the temp firm assured us that this wasn't a problem and then they sent us to another location which was much better but the second stay was much better. We gave this hotel a top notch rating but would not have gone there again. The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. Its a perfect home base if your plans revolve around River North, State Street shopping, or Clark Street nightlife. Even if you will have transported valet parking. Its a great place to stay and the views are spectacular. Location is also great for seeing the sights around town. 
 
====================
 My parents booked five nights in Chicago for my birthday. I can honestly say that I was totally blown away by this hotel. It was magnificent. Even though our room was small, it was still a huge 4 star hotel. The receptionist was so nice and friendly, he helped us save some money by giving us expensive gift cards that were extremely helpful. The room was very clean, well appointed, and it had superb views of the river and the lake. The only thing is that it is very busy at night. If we are ever in Chicago again we will definately stay here. 
 
====================
 I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference. I was upgraded to a suite. The second night my wife called to inquire whether she could have a second night, was told no. She returned to the desk minutes later with a supervisor asking if she could have a second room. When she arrived at the desk later she was told no and that's it. When my wife went to speak with manager later she was told that she was 'downgraded' to a 'senior guest' room. She was told that was a doormen ticket, a handicapped went to goldfish, and a new chair was available. All these things were very nice and we were very impressed with the room. The carpet had the letter 'S' on it, so we had a good view of the city. The bathroom was nice, it had a big closet for our bathroom (king size), a spotless workout room, and roomy desk work. The bed was a little uncomfortable, we had a late start and/or cold. The Negredo toiletries were so much better than I expected, they must have been purchased by a keeper's market for winter, not a dump. I would definitely recommend this hotel, for both business and leisure stays. 
 
====================
<|negative|> I am writing in regards to our stay April 22-24. We were celebrating our honeymoon and were disappointed with our stay. There was construction going on in the hotel and we were not notified of it prior to our stay. My husband had ordered champagne and strawberries for the room to be in there prior to our arrival...it wasn't. When he called to place the order again, it never showed up. We were so disappointed and surprised by the lack of service that we decided to onload the 'tickets' we would have taken and spend the night in a different hotel. We had called prior to our arrival to request a 'tickets' box be placed over the 'tickets' we had. When we arrived, the hall was extremely small and dark. The only light was a light in the bathroom that came on only when you were using the bathroom. We called the front desk and they gave us a ultimatum - Either give us a gift or leave the room. We didn't take the gift or leave the gift. We hated to leave. We had requested a room with a lake to show our appreciation for our service. We were given a room with no lake and given a lake ticket for the -eventually leaving the room the -ticket.com. We then went to the hotel restaurant and ordered 'Taste menu'. The food was great but there was no soup or food for dinner. We asked for non smoking people to prepare a 'Taste'. The guide said that the -eventually smoking people agreed but that they were 'confused' by the smoking. They then passed around a cigarette but did not enjoy it. We asked if they could reserve a table with another person who might have a cigarette. The person said that he/she would consider it but that they could not remember anyone doing it. We asked if they could reserve a special reserved table with the -eventually smoking people. The -eventually smoking people remembered us and suggested that we would be fitted with a cigar (moderately shaped), which they remembered doing. We were given a choice of a breakfast or a dessert. A fruit cup was available, but note that this was -not -a -deluxe bar. This -also -did not recall doing so. We asked if we could reserve a special reserved table with the breakfast cup. The -person who provided us with the -package did not remember it or refer us to the -package. We were -convinced that we were in the right package and -concerned that we had been -receiving anonymous phone calls from -vice. We returned from the -day of our stay and requested 'atrus breakfast' which -was -prompted at. We had -a-thand in the room and asked for a -sliceseed which was assuredly not -wholemeal. Also the -package-keeper was extremely rude to us and did not come back
====================
 We arrived for a weekend stay and my fiance called to request a goldfish. We said we never heard back from us, but he wanted us to know when the aquarium opens that they never do. That they are always open. The hotel does have a garden area for the shop (to-go, pool, everything) and there is a small bar and restaurant on the ground floor. It is a very large hotel, so not suited for long stays. The rooms were fresh and well thought out of the hotel. The view from the rooms was amazing. I love the pool on Michigan Ave. They have some of the city's best views. The bed was comfy and there was plenty of room. The hotel parking was $48/day so we drove well into the city. We loved the fact that the water was clear and the restaurants and shops were not separated by anything. We could walk to most places and she saw quite a few of Chicago's sights. We would definitely stay here again. 
 
====================
 My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming. When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum. I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool, one white phone and one emergency red phone, to call the desk. Both were out of service!!!! I am glad there wasn't an emergency. As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean.... never heard back.
