 "I recently stayed here at the InterContinental Chicago hotel. I had high expectations following my 2 week stay, and I'm not sure I'd have any regrets. When I arrived, the line was still running, and I was not greeted by anyone. When I checked in, they told me that I was a non-complimentary guest entering the lobby. I had checked the hallways and was greeted by a series of eyes looking directly into the camera, which was configured to PM when I checked in. No, it wasn't taken off my rental, and I did not have a room PM based on the pictures on the website, but it was easily done. The food took over an hour to get from the check-in to my room. When I received my room, it was dreadful. It was probably made up from the garbage I got in, and the carpet was torn open in an effort to make room for a next-door neighbor. The room was big enough for my liking, and while it didn't have the cleanest bathroom I've ever seen (I couldn't walk on the toilet without falling) it did have the worst part - the ice bucket was missing. I got a new bucket, and it was about 2 days later. Because of the horrible service I received from the hotel staff, I never came back down to the lobby to check in, because the front desk staff was not curtious or gracious enough to help me empty the bucket. I was so disappointed in this hotel.
" 
====================
 "I have stayed at many hotels from many different walks of life. This list is a bit long, but as we all know by the time we leave the hotel we have already booked some. However, there are plenty of places to stay in Chicago with the right amenities, and the same applies to the guest rooms. You don't get the same rate at several different chains, so expect the same or better service. I have nothing but hate for the concierge, my family and me.
" 
====================
 "My wife and I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago, Il. and were very impressed with the boutique designer's design and experience. The hotel was very elegant, classy and very spotless. The only down side is the bathroom was dirty and it took a long time to be cleaned (up to that point it had not been changed). The rest of the experience was a bit of a disappointment with the small intimate room and unimpressive bathroom. Overall it was a pleasant surprise that I did not enjoy myself.
" 
====================
 "The Ambassador East Hotel is a terrible place to stay. They are very old and outdated hotel. They are also very unfriendly. If you like a hotel like this one, I hope you will stay elsewhere.
" 
====================
 "The taxi was quite pricey, and the wait was exorbitant. We arrived at about 3:30pm for check-in. Our room was by the elevator w/car alarm clock. The front desk clerk was extremely rude to us. She said 'I can't guarantee your reservation; you need to get a new room every time you make the elevator ride'. Great; didn't have that experience. Later in the week I called the front desk to have a room assigned to someone else, and was told 'no problem'; we were assigned Scottrade Motel 6, which is much better. At checkout, the clerk rolled her eyes and said she couldn't help us; 'you know I like Kimpton hotels, do you think I would have booked this at this hotel?' I said no; she rolled her eyes again and gave me a brand-name motel to use. When we called up to reserve the Omni, I was told it was a Kimpton - it was the same as the regular motel. When we called down to the front desk, she told us there were no other rooms available, and that the only place to stay was at this hotel. I said we're stuck with one, and pointed to the parking garage for alternate lodging. She called me back two hours later, and said there was no other rooms available, and she would call me back later to discuss it. She said they had already assigned us a room, but it would be charged to your account. I said if we gave up, I'd never do that again. So she called down to the front desk, and they told us they had two rooms available, but the rate for one was ridiculous! I said we could at least try, and then two hours later, they told us there were no other rooms available. I said we could at least wait until the next day, when we returned with our check. So they said if we wanted another room, we could give it to them, then we would give it that way. They said they would, but we said we were stuck with the same problems. We asked if we could go back to the lobby and someone would take our room there. They said they would, and so did we. Two hours later, someone came into the room and took a look at the room. It was dirty, had mold in the bathroom sink, and had a fire smell that permeated the entire room. We called the front desk, and the room manager came up to look at the situation, but was met with a cold attitude. He said the cleaning staff have been through-checked, and the room was then upgraded to a suite. While we were waiting for the suite to be upgraded, a customer came up to look at the toilet and found the same mold and odor. He had to go through the replacement fixtures in the room, and the cleaning staff did a great job of cleaning the bathroom and changing it at the same time. While we were waiting, a series of customer service errors occurred. We repeatedly made sure the room was clean, and when the cleaning staff were not able to get it to do its job, we felt as if we were being shamed and felt the need to seek professional attention at a cost. In total, we spent far too much money on this room and too little time in our personal in-room remedy.
" 
====================
 "First off, don't get a 3-star hotel because that will cost you $100 less a night and more trouble than you are paying in. I stayed at the Allegro for a three nights on the phone with the hotel and was told no room available for buy 2-3. They gave me 2-3 cheaper rooms which is twice the price of the one I paid for. When I called the hotel they told me the phone was down they gave me a new room and I was able to have twice as many phone calls as I paid. The president was in town for a conference and we didn't have a room available even though we had booked the hotel three nights in advance. When I went to complain they ignored me and offered nothing to me to make up for what I had paid for. I have stayed at many hotels that have always been a great choice. The hotel they are in is no different than any other hotel or any other Hilton. The rooms are small and they look like they have been serviced by a maid. The restaurants and bars are nice but they are not the best for the money. They do have a beautiful website but it is outdated and the food is horrible. Overall, I was very disappointed with my stay at the Allegro.
" 
====================
 "I've recently stayed at the James Hotel in Chicago and I have to say, it has been the worst hotel experience I've ever had! From the rude staff to the ridiculously expensive rates and are to room service what I would say is booking a terrible stay, you can't even get the service you demand from Hilton Chicago than from room service! And then they don't deliver! I had to call down to the front desk every day and they practically told me 'You know what I'm going to do about it'... I did! The beds were literally too soft and the room view was terrible. The food they serve is disgusting and mediocre to be enjoyed by a family of four. If you like to eat, stay away!
" 
====================
 "I arrived at the Hotel Allegro Chicago and I was not impressed with it at all. The staff was very unfriendly and the waiters were not very friendly either. The room service was expensive and done in a hurry, but the food arrived right in the room. I was disappointed and I would not return.
" 
====================
 "This hotel is totally overpriced. The room was not clean when I got here, the clerk claimed that the room was not ready and then we had to wait half an hour for the 'in' button to be pressed. The food was cold and not cooked when it should have been warm. The 'in' button did not open and close quickly, it was impossible to get the temperature I had listed. The bathroom did not smell of the right food and there were very odd bedding patterns. We brought our suitcases as we came in also. The ones that were properly sized were normal sized. When I brought them up to the room they remained in their normal place, but there was a faint sweet scent of tobacco. The next day the temperature went down to certain levels and I nearly passed out. It wasn't until very soon after I passed out that I looked at the counter and discovered that the hotel had been cheapskating. I had made a formal complaint to the hotel but they didn't bother to send me any word about the incident. They did send me a new room but I couldn't get it to open because the software did not support it. I couldn't use the wi-fi in the room because it wasn't very central. I passed out from lack of sleep. I wrote a letter to the hotel but they refused to listen to it. I don't know how they manage this many people and they seem to be trying very hard to keep people from coming in and out. I didn't get a good deal at all and I don't think I will be returning anytime soon.
" 
====================
 "Stayed at the Talbott, expecting much better reviews. Very disappointed. Room was not particularly clean, even though I had called ahead to ask for the no sleep order. It looked like the no sleep order was given after about 20 minutes of waiting. I had to call back the consierge, as they had no records of getting my reservation. Finally, at reservation time, the air/hot wire was not in the room and the no noise policy was notin. Only when I complainedon of the record keeping, did the staff tell medenial was not true. I was soooo upset, and they broke up my sleep order and never got back to me. I had a conference call with the housekeeping, but the receptionist did nothing to try to help me, except throw me a @ and word alluding to how 'tough' it was, 'because' is not a good word. After a lot of arguing, the management was able to get this far. I still had a long way to go until I actually reach my room. The bed was very comfortable, but made me feel very sick, as if I wereheaded. The bathroom was not that great, but was pretty fun, too. Overall, my experience was very bad, and I will never stay here again.
" 
====================
 "This hotel was not worth it. The staff was unfriendly and rude, and the bar looked like a used band-aid on a long and complicated road to recovery. Don't book this hotel in the summer. It's empty.
" 
====================
 "I recently stayed at The Talbott Hotel in Chicago and willfully updated, it has gone downhill in comparison to previous hotels I have stayed at. One thing that once was beautiful but has fallen apart. The bathrooms are tiny with only a few elevators and they are very crowded. I was particularly unhappy with the lighting. Even the headboard is not free as it has been converted. The lobby bar is very closed off and a sofabile is present. The lights are not as good as at home and I usually have to go to the pool and gym with my family. The rooms are not as good as they used to be but have not aged as well as they used to. The Talbott might be annoying but it's not worth the trade-off.
" 
====================
 "Very disappointed in our stay. The hotel is beautiful and offers many amenities than what we were expected. The room was larger than we expected, and the bathroom was not at capacity. We were excited to try the restaurant and the lounge was nice at the end of the tunnel. We would not stay here again.
" 
====================
 "I stayed here for a weekend while visiting some friends in town and they were really helpful and friendly but the hotel really did not look like we were there for any particular purpose. The walls were so thin that most of the staff tried to stare at us as we walked in and out of the hotel. The people at the front desk were not very helpful and the front desk do not seem to care that we are costing so much money on the internet. I also had a personal problem with a scampered lady and she worked backwards from the phone while I was trying to find a missing package. Overall there were very few positives regarding this hotel.
" 
====================
 "Ok, so I am a recent college graduation of mine, and I'm already avoiding this hotel for the foreseeable future. The hotel itself is pretty nice, they bring us a room that we like (or hate) minus the wi-fi. But the rooms itself aren't that nice either. I mean, there are plenty of other nice hotels in Chicago such as this where I get plenty of dollars for my stay. I wouldn't stay here again.
" 
====================
 "We booked this hotel for a Thursday through Saturday night. We had a AAA convention in Chicago downtown and our company was celebrating their 20th anniversary. We were extremely disappointed with the service from the hotel's website and at the front desk employees who obnoxiously signed up to sign up for the club newsletter. They were the worst men that I have ever been. When we arrived at the hotel we were told us that we would have to pay extra for a bar snack, when fact we were already paying for the entire stay. They told us the bar snack was a small sandwich that had to be purchased at the hotel. When we pointed this out they told us that the cost of the snack was already prohibitive. So, we asked for a different bar snack. Not one penny of it. They told us that this was a special discount we was getting special offers from the hotel. I understand that this was a busy and bustling hotel and that there were tourists travails, but this was not the hotel we were expecting. We understand that this is common sense and that some aspects may be out of our control. However, we should not discount the hospitality of the employees who were already helping us. When we checked in, the woman at the front desk acted as if we were guests only because we had reserved a room with a king size bed. We were not even allowed to change rooms. Room service breakfast was a scam and was billed on our first night, not included in our bill. The net outcome: I have no choice to stay here and will resort to booking better rooms and booking more money for luxury accommodations when visiting Chicago.
" 
====================
 "We stayed here because of all the great reviews on Trip Advisor and we really loved it. But we soon knew that this was a trap because of the rave reviews. We called the front desk, and was told that they were closed for maintenance on July 1st. That was a week later. When I called back, they said the garage was working on their car and that we were unable to get it serviced. On the anniversary of the party, we gave this property three stars and would definitely stay here again.
" 
====================
 "I just returned from my first visit to Chicago and stayed this hotel on my first floor. As soon as I stepped through the elevators I noticed that there was smoke everywhere. The front desk made me wait in the lobby for them to come come out. When they finally came out, there was nothing to disturb me at all. The only thing that disturbed me was the over-hyped look of the lobby they put up on their website. I was completely disapointed, even though I had booked a room with a great view, right down to the over-priced, giant-pubic bathroom that they decorated in such a way that my legs were spread out in the room. I had to sit in the back for four hours until they came up. They did bring me a new room, but I was already very disapointed. I thought that maybe because I was so busy in the morning, I wasn't as tired so I could rest up some more. That night I was very disappointed, in that I felt that the lights didn't go on when I went to sleep. In the morning, I went to the pool, in that room. I did get all the towels and wear them out quickly, but that was just the beginning of my problems. After my own party that night, I went down to the bar and had a little bit of a drinking. I thought that it was a lot of money for the price, but it was actually far less than I was expecting. I was very disappointed in the food. It didn't take long for the hype for my reviews to start flying around the internet and spreading all over the place. Mostly because it looked like the bartender thought I was a faggot because I had a complimentary glasses of water for $9.99. What?! I was starving so I had to go to the bar. I wanted to go see the party, but my party didn't make it there. I went and bought the ticket to see the girls in person. What the hell?? What do you know?? That was a year ago when I had booked this damn hotel! It has fallen so far behind what I expected it to fall. Doormen were very helpful in getting me checked in, but when I finally got to my room, all of the way around the dorm I had a cold. I couldn't get in, so I had to go down to the lobby to get help with a hand cord, and it took almost a hour to get me in. For the price I was paying, it was an awful experience, I will never EVER stay there again.
" 
====================
 "This hotel is totally overrated. Yes, the location is awesome, but there are plenty of other nearby hotel options. The customer service, or lack thereof, was particularly disappointing. Why are they paying anywhere from 2 - 8 doormen yet none of them can ever actually open the door for a lady? Even when her hands are full. The housekeeping staff couldn't figure out our preferences even after we left them a daily note explicitly stating such along with a tip -every day. Why ask what newspaper we want with our morning room service when you don't bring it anyway. As stated previously, the location is great. Location, however, does not make up for the complete lack of customer service and inattentiveness from staff. I would not stay here again.
" 
====================
 "I booked my stay at the James Chicago Hotel looking for a fun, boutique hotel that was coming off of an already great run of hotel in the Chicago area. While this definitely wasn't my cup of tea, I believe management did miss the mark on the right people. When I registered for the room I was given the impression that there was actually a single sitting room available. No 'Queen bed'. No 'King and Queen'. This was a converted theater. No 'Wellness room'. It was just non-existent. Needless to say I will not be staying here again.
" 
====================
 "Over all, Hard Rock Hotel Chicago is a great hotel. I work there every day of the week and there are some that I'm not aware of are Le Meridian Hotel, Monarch, Monaco, Ambassador East, Crowne Plaza, Millennium Park, etc. All these are just a few blocks away from my location. The hotel is nice though, and the customer service is excellent. The location is perfect for getting to Michigan Ave. shopping or Omni's. Looking north on Michigan Ave. is just a short, sweet walk to see some State Street. I've found that even though there are a few bad apples in the loop, there are so many more that will come! 
" 
====================
 "I had reservations to stay in this hotel but was disapointed. Firstly the reservationeller couldn't find my reservation and told me I had to come get it. I called down to check and they said they couldn't give me a name or number of the room they didn't have available. I went down and complained and later at the front desk. They said they were happy to give me that number and that I wouldn't have to tell anyone. They also gave me the state of my room. The building was old and the plumbing was badly rusty. I complained and the day went by when I finally got a good look at the room. I saw there was mold around the toilet and a film over the mirror. I called down to the front desk and they said they couldn't give me that type of a room. I moved into a king bed for the night and it was very uncomfortable. Because of the high bed rate it was very noisy. The next morning the air conditioner was hot and we had a continuous noise throughout the night. The bathroom was very noisy. Breakfast for breakfast was uncomfortable and could hear music from the adjoining room. We would not return to this hotel.
" 
====================
 "We booked our room at the Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago with the view of the Chicago River. We were extremely disappointed with the accommodations the hotel offered. It is not a hallmark hotel and certainly does not live up to the billing. My wife at the Geneva Hotel offered him the worst room ever! The bed was extremely uncomfortable and my wife at the Sheraton offered his or her a free (all expenses and discount) wedding certificate to the hotel. I would have taken advantage of any such offer he had. My wife even suggested we could have the wedding ceremony at the Swissotel, which would have been a nice bonus for us. We declined. Then we had to spend a night there as we had a meeting the next day and it was very disappointing. We spent a large amount of money on a meeting which was below expectations. We have stayed in the Swissotel twice and are anxious to return the favor. If the Swissotel wants to stay in the Chicago it needs to offer customers the luxury it has long been known for -- it offers an in-room spa experience only accessible through the in-house hotel's computerized card reader! My wife also appreciated the in-room dinning service, which she appreciated as well. I would not hesitate to make business trips to Chicago if offered the opportunity. The customer service was also not good enough for my three sisters: my mother, father and sister-in-law. My mother-in-law had to travel a lot to get here and three of her sisters--none of whom had any charge for room service--worked here. My sisters are four more years old so the amount of extra work she's put into this hotel could barely cover the additional time they will be spending here. My mother-in-law also spent a large amount on robes and goblets and all this work has put strain on our backs and comfort is a result. This hotel is too big and too many are in use.
" 
====================
 "The heating in our room was broken down and our air condition was not properly staffed. Additionally, our room did not even appear on the rental website!
" 
====================
 "I stayed at the Hilton Chicago recently and was extremely disappointed. The hotel is very old and out of step with the rest of the area. There are many great restaurants in the area and the noise level was horrible. The best thing about this hotel is they offer the free shuttle to the Magnificent Mile for entertainment. The driver for this shuttle was a 37 year old who had just passed 50. The shuttle was a $299 value and a $40 taxi ride from the hotel. I would definitely recommend staying here for the entertainment value but the price could be a bit steep.
" 
====================
 "I had such high hopes when I booked a stay at the Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago a few short weeks ago. When I arrived I should have known things would not be as I expected them to be. The host at the desk was rude and seemed put out that I was there. When I finally arrived at the hotel I was met with a rude and arrogant receptionist. I had no clue where to checkout the desk, or even where to shop at the finest. I was so disappointed and truly want to leave this wonderful city I have_preferred_to_going here.
" 
====================
 "During my recent stay at the Ambassador East Hotel, I was severely disappointed. I have learned the hard way that the Hard Rock is always there for gal, if you please. She replaced a full size waiter on the staff who was rude and acted like I was trying to rude her. They put on a show at the Celebrity Apprentice but I ended up getting a worse room because of the rude service.
" 
====================
 "Have I been staying at this hotel before? I've had wonderful accommodations at some of the best hotels in Chicago. The rooms are luxurious and the beds are among the best I've ever slept in. In fact, I have spent more time in a bed at a fancy restaurant as it would be luxurious. The restaurants are the best thing I've ever been able to do within walking distance of the hotel and the food is exquisite! I'll definitely be back.
" 
====================
 "I recently had the displeasure of staying at the Conrad Chicago. From the time I walked in I noticed that the cleaning staff had dirty towels in the bathroom. I called down to front desk they sent up replacements for the towels. Unfortunately I had to take a shower and the tub did not drain. I was truly disappointed and truly I'm upset about this negative experience. I was at the reservation counter about 2:15 PM on a Thursday afternoon. When I got there the clerk looked at me and said I had a 'suitcase' and asked her to send me some new towels. She did and replaced the old ones as they said they would not cut it anymore. And so I was sent to a room that had been cleaned twice in one afternoon. The room was plush at best and I felt out of my shower stall a bit. My room was average with a twin with two bathrooms. The King size bed was uncomfortable and uncomfortable then and there are much better accommodations for you in less time than you will spend enjoying a Chicago hotel. If you have any concerns about service or the quality of the room then definitely consider checking out. If you have any special needs or would just like a quick shower with a nice tub, then this is the hotel for you. The staff is very friendly and are not rude. I especially liked the bathroom where the softest towels were and always were. I was very impressed with the complimentary gym access and well placed cardio machines. I also had one small complaint about the bed. While it was very comfortable and was VERY comfortable, there was very little toe space in the tub for the sitting area or the toilet. The linens on the bed were very uncomfortable and I literally fell on my own floor as if I was trying to stand on it. I was never able to get the toilet to open up as there was so little space. Also, the room had very few loose threads which made it very difficult to clean and if you sleep in it outside as some hotels do, make sure you do not have loose threads as they are very inviting areas for the eye to look for. Overall I was very pleased with my stay at the Conrad Chicago. I will definitely go back. 
" 
====================
 "We booked this hotel for the second leg of our Chicago stay..it was great!!!! We had a great rate through TripAdvisor..$249 per night for a 'classical hotel.' We were very disappointed with the hotel. We had heard that it was in a great area and had options to get in and out, but nothing was offered to upset us. We had looked at Amalfi hotels in other cities but that never had anything against the Conrad Chicago. We were so disappointed with this hotel. The room was unbelieveably small! We came here for a night stay and the room came with a stool in the bathroom. It was terribly visible, as expected when booking online. The decor was dated, it was stained in some way, and there was a musty odor coming from the toilet. The king bed was extremely uncomfortable. The sheets were extremely uncomfortable - if you did not pay a fortune for a bed, don't use it. The tub was large and water pressure was off-limits. Our only regret - it's an old hotel, although it is in a great location and is in a great location is also charged an additional rate based on your location. I would not recommend the Conrad Chicago. I would rather stay at a palace like the Four Seasons were, and will stay at a palace.
" 
====================
 "My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming. When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum. I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool, one white phone and one white phone, to call the desk. Both were out of service!!!! I am glad there wasn't an emergency and the pool was clean and the staff were very friendly. I would not stay there again.
" 
====================
 "I was looking forward to staying here for my wedding in late September, and was surprised by the signs of hard times that were subtle, but affected me and my husband. For example, he got locked out of our room 2 times, once having to wait for 15 minutes in the hallway after going to the spa. The other time was when he was getting ready for our wedding ceremony, so that was stressful because he lost some time. The keycard just would stop working. Then a fuse blew, so we had no power while trying to get ready. It happened to me also, coming back from the spa, and I called on the hallway phone to get help. Luckily, right after that, a gambler came into our room who tried to cap off our vacation. He stole a bunch of cash, threw it in my room, and then went back to stealing another person's money. All of this was really stressful because he was always worried about getting his money back. I called the front desk, and they said they would take care of the issue, but had not. They did, however, electronically activate our credit and debit cards and leave out the forename line for our rooms. It was very frustrating because even though we got a new room with a different name than the one we had reserved, the change was not made to our bill, no room to call home, or give up on anything. It was just too much to bear. We were so looking forward to doing our part to make sure that our guests enjoy their stay at Chicago's Fairmont.
" 
====================
 "Ok, my wife and I just spent a week at Trump Tower. We were placed on the 5th floor, facing the hotel, while heaped heavy luggage and very uncomfortable bedding. We were constantly reminded of our rooms before we were put in them. The furnishings were disturbingly yellowed anduccaneous and the covers were scratchy and extremely scratchy. The decor was a bit garish and the bed very stiff. The cleaning staff did a poor job, since my wife was cleaning the toilet. It reminded me of that old film day spa day scene in Harry Potter where you have to beat the hell out of a toilet. We were only in the hotel for 1 night, but were quickly moved to a different room, where we were improved by great treatment, fantastic toilet service, and some great American food. The yellowboards were from the last Chicago Trump shoot, which was going to be over within a few weeks. Despite being placed on the 5th floor, the hotel made it up there even though it was a lot darker. I'll never go back.
" 
====================
 "Our stay at the Talbott was a horrible experience. We did not have a wonderful experience. First of all, our room was not clean when we arrived and this was very inconvenient. When we finally got to the room, it was a nightmare. The carpet had not been cleaned and the sheets were foul smelling. After we explained to the staff that we were hungry, they kicked us out of the room and they took all of our bags back to the front desk. After that horrible experience, I would recommend going to a different hotel for your trip. The prices are very expensive there are many options there, you will be disappointed.
" 
====================
 "The hotel does not appear to be inspected when you arrive. The person at the front desk did not clean the room nor would there be anyone in the line of duty room when I arrived to clean. After checking in the hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. I will not book here again.
" 
====================
 "Attended a wedding in Chicago; chose not to return. Ordered room service only for the hotel's gross error of a net, arrived 30 minutes after I had requested and was told, " Come on! You think you're getting a free room upgrade when you actually get one? Well, my two cents! When arrived my bill was incorrect and the front desk employee was very rude to me. At check in I was informed that my room was not on the list, but instead of appealing I was told to go back to the front desk and get a new room. I then went to my room and noticed that everything was wrong. I went to the counter and complained to the clerk. I went to the lobby and one of the clerks scoffed at me and said that there was nothing the clerk could do. I informed him of this to get him to reconsider. I then asked why in the world they had the gross error of a net when I had requested a room that included an upgrade in July. Why would a gross error of a net be available when I was going to check in after July 6? Why would they cut in line service if I requested a room that had upgrade questions? This is a hot, youth-dominated area of Chicago and I believe most guests would be comfortable with a room that did not specificallyify me of the disaster compensation package. I also was disappointed with the quality of service from the hotel staff. I had high hopes for my stay, staying at the Swissotel Chicago was supposed to be a pleasant experience. The staff was highly professional and answered my every need. The hotel was full of problem areas and the carpet didn't meet the cleanliness standards I was hoping for. The room was quiet, the Aveda bed was ours, but they didn't even bring it up to our room. The noise from the elevator is always a promise of an upgrade in the morning. If you're traveling with a child or teenager, I would highly recommend that you check for their services before booking. I also strongly encourage you to check at the hotel's website, as they are still host to their minor mistakes.
" 
====================
 "This hotel was chosen for me for a business convention. The lobby looks nice, but is actually just a big pain in the ass. The people are not friendly or welcoming. I was not greeted by any of the people at the front of the hotel. Even the people who direct the business center are not friendly or welcoming. The food is horrible and I give this hotel a two and up.
" 
====================
 "This hotel is not worth the price. It was not worth the money. If you want a good deal, spend your money elsewhere.
" 
====================
 "This hotel is totally overrated. Yes, the location is awesome, but there are plenty of other nearby hotel options. The customer service, or lack thereof, was particularly disappointing. Why are they paying anywhere from 2 - 8 doormen yet none of them can ever actually open the door for a lady? Even when her hands are full. The housekeeping staff couldn't figure out our preferences even after we left them a daily note explicitly stating such along with a tip -every day. Why ask what newspaper we want with our morning room service when you don't bring it anyway. As stated previously, the Starwood location is a lot better than the Hookahare in the Mile.
" 
====================
 "The hotel is in a good location. It is very modern with colors and decor very much like what you would expect from a luxury hotel. The rooms are very comfortable and well decorated, even the lobby is worth the extra money. It does have the unfortunate feature of having traffic and noise from the hotel next door. If you do not stay there they probably have a new music band playing that is getting loud.
" 
====================
 "I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel, and I must say, it felt a little fake and old. The rooms were small, the bathrooms were pretty small, and yes, there was some noise from the city noise. But nothing that I noticed as I was walking around the hotel. There are a million other hotels I would rate Fairmont a D+, but this wasn't one of them.
" 
====================
 "We stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel in early December 2010. I have nothing but hate for the management who claims to be a 'world class hotel,' yet who instead of recognizing our 'world class' rating and perks are promoting their own brand of luxury, and actually discriminating against the very people who booked our rooms! There is no way I'd stay here, and don't think I will never stay here again.
" 
====================
 "Attended a conference at the Omni Chicago Hotel and although we had stayed there on business, booked our reservations based on several factors. First, it was offered to us by a benefactor of the hotel. Second, it was an excellent location. Third, it was a small room compared to other Omni hotels in the area. Fourth, it was booked well. Fifth, it was reasonably priced. Sixth, an excellent travel companion.
" 
====================
 "I recently stayed here at the Talbott Hotel, in downtown Chicago. I was very disappointed with my stay. 1. The room was very small. I wanted to give them a try. They gave me a corner room. However, it was smaller than I expected. I would have liked to see a larger futon or some sort of couch. I was also surprised that there was no mini-bar. I'd have to pay about $7.00 a night to go back to the hotel. 2. The tub was cracked and the water pressure was off. I was very disappointed in the towels. Although I paid about $10 more than I was quoted, they were still far above average. I would never book at this hotel again.
" 
====================
 "After reading all the hyperefficient comments on this website, I was expecting a true luxury experience. I found it one. The Talbott Hotel has a great view of the Chicago River and Millenium Park. It also has a great breakfast and evening cocktails. However, for the price I paid, I was expecting a luxury experience. Although the lobby is beautiful and chic, the room was more glamorous than I expected. The pillows were less than what I would have expected, the closet was smaller, and the bathroom was a closet instead of a bathroom. The coolest thing about the hotel was the location. It's in the middle of a shopping spree for the best hotel. This is a great little spot on the top of everything else. The rooms were beautiful and the views were great. I didn't have a problem with smoking, but if I did, I would've been better off just staying indoors. The hotel staff was super helpful and friendly. I definitely recommend the Talbott to anyone staying downtown or trying to cut across the line in their shopping.

====================
 "After booking a room at the Omni Chicago Hotel, I was made to feel like royalty by the receptionist. When I arrived to check in, the person at the desk was rude and seemed to ignore my complaint about the room. After waiting half an hour for the room to be ready, I finally got it, but the woman at the front desk made a snide comment on the extra towels I had to use (gave me a headache). She assured me that they were all the right size, but I still had the reservation. I was put on hold for another half an hour, and then finally asked to confirm my reservation with the hotel. I confirmed it again, and again, and then it still was a hold. Finally, I was given the key to the room. I was on the 5th floor, in a hall with no view. The receptionist was extremely rude and told me I was in the 'pub' room. Supposedly, the rooms are supposed to be that high class, but I've been down to the historic rooms and they are not that high class. I was given a room on the 8th floor, by the way, by the hotel itself. It was supposed to be a quiet room, but I swear was there a bellhop? Working in the lobby, 10 men line up, all of them eager to please! I swear it was like working at a big corporation, they threatened to close the doors of my room, and threatened to cut me off for business. I had a horrible flight, and will never stay at this hotel again.

 "Elegant lobby, small room but lovely bathroom. Doesn't say room on the front has extra leg room as others have.

====================
 "After reading all the good reviews I decided to try the Chicago Palmer House. I really did not want to come back to Chicago where I had had so many wonderful vacations, so I decided to stay here. I did exactly what they say: I will be back: I book a cruise to Chicago from New York City where I had seen some of their wonderful hotels. During the booking process I did make exception for a few people because I had preferences I held dear. I was surprised when I signed up for the club. The offer was ruined by two emails that were quickly removed from the email list. One was from a man who pretended to be a security guy at the hotel, but actually were two slightly different people. The second person was from the office who pretended to be a stock clerk at the club, who I pretended was genuinely surprised that I had chosen this hotel. I was very humiliated and angry and had to call them back down to the clerk. I had booked the exact hotel that they were supposed to be coming back from kidding about. Again the offer was ruined by the two emails and the email list. I called the front desk and was told that not only was the hotel closed they were making no effort to accommodate me or their guests. I was really very angry and cannot even describe how angry and frustrated they must be. They are actually training some of the security staff at the hotel to behave badly. They are obviously not trusted and will not make the same mistakes again. Please do not go to the Chicago Palmer House. I will resort to physical therapy if I have to stay here. It would be a gross mistake, and truly shameful staying at a hotel this big.
" 
====================
 "My son and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming. We were booked into a tiny room. No snobby Scout teams, no room that advertized's worth of swimming. I asked for a nonsmoking room and was told there were no smoking rooms. No kidding. I ended up getting a nonsmoking room. That was only the beginning. The room was larger than I expected and the shower was horrible. They charge for your room type, but I only used what I felt were their facilities for one night. The Marathon was a big part of it, too. I'll never waste my time or money in the Palmer House again.
" 
====================
 "My family and I stayed here for a weekend in Chicago and were very disappointed. The James Chicago is a huge Hilton home away from the place. 1. There is no pool in the hotel. 2. the lobby desk is very crowded. We called down to front desk they said our property was upvoted and we got a free room. 3. The front desk staff was not helpful. We had to call down to housekeeping to order for potatoes to be foraged. 4. Our room was not ready yet. 5. The room was dirty. We had to call down to housekeeping to actually get potatoes for breakfast. 6. The mirror in the room do not show where the bathroom leads. 7. The pool is small and does not have a pool table. We are pet friendly, so we had to ask for a table 6 times in hopes of finding a pet friendly pool. We are elephants and do not want to be bothered with a pet. We have stayed at many different hotels and this may vary from hotel to hotel. For one person we were disappointed, but for many we were totally okay. This is a very large hotel and may not be as good as a hotel we usually enjoy.
" 
====================
 "My wife and I just spent the whole week on the phone with our credit card company to ask them to reconsider our card. When we got to our rooms, we found they were not connected to the internet and refused to do anything to help us out. Our room was next to the fire alarm, so we called to complain and get help. The police report we received did not list a night manager, but we called around to several credit card fraudulently connected towing places in the area and discovered that there were others also at the hotel, so investigating, we called the hotel directly and called on line. The general manager, who seemed to be in his usual peppery demeanor, would not comment for fear of sounding snobby, and he never bothered to provide us with a copy of his record. When we complained to the general manager, he always claimed he was 'out of town' and never saw us through. When we visited at the last minute, we asked for our room to be serviced up, again, NEVER! The hotel itself is beautiful and the staff is suave and nice. But to put that....in a top drawer? Doesn't make sense. The dining accommodations were okay, but the quality of them was horrible. I would not stay here again.

 "I work for a software engineer job and for the past 3 years I have been a full time mother and daughter vacation maker. When we got to San Francisco we stayed through the in room service. This hotel need not be classified as a luxury hotel. This hotel is a luxury vacation maker. The rooms are modern leaning with a nice but modern take on the traditional draw. I. Cleanliness: This hotel is beautifully decorated with a nice older style and fine dining options in a relaxed location. The hotel is also beautifully located with a few blocks of new construction being added to the picture. The lobby is a great place to chill and have a drink. The staff is extremely friendly and very helpful. We got a great rate through Expedia and thought that the luxury package was the better of the two. I. The Best: This hotel is only a five minute walk to the Magnificient Mile and the Hotel Monaco. If you need a package you will only find the Monaco, make no mistake. This hotel is a must stay at place to visit. Even though it is an older hotel, the service is first class. The room service is slow, the food in the restaurant is cold, and the waiters and waitresses are very short. If you are on a budget, I suggest you check for its in amenities right away. Its only a $200 per night hidden in an in room extras package. Its prices are a bit ridiculous for the grade but its a great place to stay and we will defiantly stay there again. 
" 
====================
 "A small boutique hotel in Chicago called 'The Palmer House Hilton' which I checked was not the best name for the place. They offer nothing exciting for the money, but more amenities and the sense of style is more appealing. The place is definitely understaffed and the rooms are cheaply made. I felt that we stayed at a 'suite' to be treated like guest in a lavish hotel. The location was good, as the suites were furnished with anything but fancy names. Although we were within walking distance to restaurants and the downtown area, we quickly got lost. The staff was incredibly rude when we came back late at night, telling us 'look, you two are not worth it.' I don't understand why some people have trouble being helpful, even when they know they have to be rude. Was it worth it? Probably not. Others did a better job, such as the bartender at the bar at The Palmer House. It wasn't worth it at all. We will not be staying here at all at the Palmer House.
" 
====================
 "My family and I were amazed by the Swissotel in Chicago. When we walked into the room it was much nicer than we expected. The decor was very elegant and the room was very comfortable. When we were finally finished with our luggage the room was very clean and comfortable. Upon checking in the staff was very friendly and very helpful. They had no problem tipping us, even though we were paying at least $50 a night for the continental breakfast. We would definitely stay here again! 
" 
====================
 "I wrote a review of this hotel back in July, but which hotel has never had a terrible stay at Trump's Hotel Chicago? Yes, the Omni is Expensive, but the Price they charge makes up for in Comfort and Inexpensive. The price of a room at this hotel is nothing short of luxurious. My wife and I stayed in one of the most luxurious rooms we've ever stayed in. It was like living in luxury, with the perfect views, when actually in the city of Chicago. The room was impeccably clean, as every previous reviewer noted. The only glitch with the room is they allow you to browse the internet in the room, but it is only during the day because the internet is out. Everything in the room looked and felt like a dream. The only glitch involved the key. It's an unlocked room that sometimes appears to be your brother's, but really is your brother's. It's like there was no way the key was right. The only nice thing about the Omni is that there are no nasty, old fashion restaurants to be found. It is a great place to stay if you want to experience the city of Chicago as if it were your grandmother's attic. 
" 
====================
 "I booked this hotel with great expectations. I had heard good things about the Chicago Affinia hotel and the experience was anything but. Not only was the room quite charming and beautiful but the food was great. We were treated like royalty and given access to an onsite fitness center where we did not usually go out of our way to workout. Upon our arrival at the hotel I was surprised to see that there were not a ton of homeless people setting up outside in the area. We were welcomed warmly by the staff and my wife. When I arrived to check in the clerk explained that we were the 6th in line paid and that there was another half off sign reserved for guests who paid more than $200 per night. We all got our tickets in and were off to a very pleasant finish after each day. My wife got a complimentary bottle of wine and she ate it with great respect when we paid the price too. When we got back to the room the decorations in the bedroom were very colorful and decorated in a modern style. The bed was very comfortable and the duvet was very comfy. We were treated like royalty even though we paid $220 a night. If we were in the area we would plan on staying at the Ambassador East Hotel in a few months time. Would not stay again if they did not offer another hotel in the area or if they could not match what is offered there.
" 
====================
 "We stayed at this hotel with our two teenage daughters duing a part business, part family fun trip in July. We were very impressed with the location, within walking distance to great restraunts and shopping, inlcuding Water Tower Place (a great mall & restaurant), and inside the Hancock Building (a beautiful piece of work). We were quite disappointed with the room cleanlinees and size. The bedspreads were filthy and so thin. The room decor is in dire need of an upgreade. The bathroom had no fan and it really smelled badly of mold and mildew. The shower actually had mold in the corners! This was very disappointing, as the substantial downstairs dining area was just a few doors down from the elevator and it was a seedy place. I hesitated selecting the Conrad as it was only a short 2 hours away from the hotel and it was perfectly acceptable except that we found a very large uneatened buffet. This hotel is also steps away from several eye-popping dining establishments. We would choose the Conrad in every possible way! 
" 
====================
 "Stayed at the Talbott, expecting first class service, for which I was very disappointed. Service from the front desk was first class. The room was filthy, staff was unfriendly, and the manager (wink) was useless. Also, the cable car was broken in our room, and the owners of the cable car did not inform the hotel of the problem. I called the manager the next morning and was told they were done with the cable car (they were skittling it); I did not get an update on this issue; I called the manager the next day and was told he was gone, and I was saved--even printed off--a copy of the written agreement. I was so put off by the 'free' passes, I hardly ever stayed at the Talbott. The spa services were more expensive than I expected, and the prices were not in line with what I was paying. The hotel restaurant was better food, better atmosphere, and better atmosphere. I would not stay there again; instead, I recommend the Family Room with a view.
" 
====================
 "We booked this hotel with great expectations. We had looked at a number of hotels in the Chicago area, and this was probably the worst. The lobby looks clean, but the people are rude. The rooms are not really as well decorated as we thought they could be, you have to walk down the hallways and you look for a window seat. The hotel looks good on paper, but when we got there we went to see some of the sites. The problems began when we walked into the lobby. The sign said Group Only open on weekends and the opened front doors at 8:00 PM. We were expecting a girl. We called to make reservations and she said when we come to a hotel for the first night only open on certain nights, even though it was a Saturday and Sunday. The problem was when we made our reservations, they did not have the right girl. They said on the sign not to bring a virgin on these days only to find out it was a Saturday and a Sunday. We took the sign as a good sign, but they told us they never got us pregnant in these rooms. We were so disappointed. The Hotel is beautiful. The decor is very nice. The decor and location to the downtown are also nice.
" 
====================
 "My stay at the Talbott was a horrible experience. We arrived at the hotel around noon on Thursday night and my wife was already up checking in. When we finally got to check in we found her wandering around the hotel. She was wearing a niqab! She was in the lobby! We got up and went downstairs to check in and she was waiting to take our order! We got the worst reservation and was only given the Talbott 4 burritos! I am so furious and can't believe that a city worth spreading fear and dread would allow such a disgusting feature to flourish in the first place. I then directed my security person to be more specific and say something about this. NO! This is not normal hotel procedure and he was not particularly helpful. This hotel is in a terrific location and exactly where we expected to be. We paid $75 for a non-smoking room and $75 for a smoking room. The location was not the best for the wrong reasons. A few blocks from the concert venue and a few blocks from the premiere club. At an incredible 15 minutes walk we got to our room, the smoking one the complete and utter garbage. It was often the case in Chicago that the smoking part of the hotel worked for the cigar part, but the rooms left a lot to be desired. We never saw the cigar part of the rooms and the rooms left a lot to be desired. When you get the $529 Bucks Package, you get a nice room, clean room, and extremely convenient driving distance. If I pay close to $30 a night to get to the hotel, I definitely would not recommend this hotel.
" 
====================
 "I had high hopes for my stay at the Swissotel Chicago when it was listed under the Hilton brand in Chicago. Why would I bother going to a supposedly 'high-end' hotel when I know I'll get a great hotel? The good part is that the Palmer House Hilton hotel offers all the things you would expect from a high-end hotel: fabulous staff, luxury, luxury products, chic accommodations. The downside is the food they serve is a bit below what you would expect: it starts with the waiter asking you if you want some fresh food when you ask. I don't usually enjoy staying in hotels, but I did like the hotel at the Palmer House Hilton in Chicago. It's a place that I'll be back for sure. 
" 
====================
 "I booked this reservation through Priceline.com for $75 per night and was hopeful that I'd be able to get a suite after price. At check in, my hotel room was horrible. It had a burned out carpet and missing toilet paper. I had to call inline for extra towels and BOTH towels were for missing. I never received an answer right away whether they were new or used. The room was disheveled, the toilet paper spat out in front of me and on the way out, it was Dave who stood in the lobby with a wet hunk of dog fighting it out against the back of the elevators. The two of us were joined by a dog and the sheets were in the bin. I called in housekeeping and they came up right away to fix it, but it was so bad, I asked for a refund and they said they would send someone up right away to fix it. That was 2 days before my stay was finalized. The bathroom was filthy and the air conditioner clogged. On the 25th floor, I was treated for a broken door and enteric toothpaste. On the 28th floor, I was given a smoking room and great room, but I was blasted for the same thing, message on the wall beside the room. When I went to sleep, the room was still damp from the previous night. The next day, I broke in the bathroom and got a new room. But I was told the old was not repaired, not fresh, and did not work back. I was told to go back to the lobby and get a new room. But it was too late, the walls had already covered my reccomendations. I went back to the lobby the next morning and was told the bell would not get off the phone for many more calls. I had to wait on a line of men checking in to get a refund. I would not recommend the Conrad Chicago if you are looking for a cool deal.
" 
====================
 "Recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park. This hotel seems to take everything about luxury and force it down your throat. One thing that seems to not satisfied me is the amount of noise in the room. I have heard the TV in the hallway talking and making you feel extremely uncomfortable. I am not a fan of constant noise but this is definitely a hotel that I would not recommend to anyone.
" 
====================
 "I have stayed at many hotels and selected the Conrad Chicago for my review of the Swissotel concept. It exceeds my expectations. The room has a great view of the river and is equipped with comfortable beds and 42 inch flat screen TVs. Our standard room had an extra large flat screen TV and bed. We were provided with towels in the room and were able to put our binoculars in close to the window to take pictures. While the hotel is in the Chicago Loop, there is a pleasant walkable area to Lakeshore Drive and Millennium Park. For downtown Chicago travelers, the rooms are similar, but the rooms are significantly more spacious. This hotel is in a much better location for downtown dining. While dining, guests are greeted by chocolates and beverages in the lobby. The Conrad Chicago is great for groups and couples only. It is a short walk to the financial district, Soldier Field, and McCormick Place. I would not recommend the Conrad Chicago to anyone.
" 
====================
 "I had my wedding ceremony and reception at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel. Unfortunately, this hotel was recently renovated on top of its previous and much needed location. The new facility is set in the greatest location in the city, allowing guests to see the entire downtown area in one place. The guest rooms are spacious with comfortable beds and they come with fabulous amenities like iPod docking stations, chic double bookings and much higher ceilings. The hotel is fully equipped with catering and catering with guests are even able to bring up their favorite snacks at the Sofitel Chicago restaurant. While most hotels allow guests to check in early, Sofitel cater to kids free of charge, their ball rooms are very spacious and host concerts on weekends, my kids have a new favorite items and they are named After me! I cannot recommend the Sofitel highly enough. When my kids are ready they go to the ball rooms and there they get to see the new BMW X6 cars that are waiting for them. The concerts are on TV and they are very excited about the Sofitel's offer of Internet access for concerts. After my kids I head to the ballrooms area for a late night drink and perusal the websites give other interesting sites nearby. The sites also give us some insight as to the people behind the advertisements. In the end I will have to call the hotel and ask for them to hire me as a receptionist. In the end it was my business which is how I ended up with this hotel. As for the room, I had issues with the previous owners claiming they had the room upgraded. I had to call and ask for them to rework their room. I had a last minute emergency with work- I could hear noises in the hallway and every conversation I had with someone else within 10 feet of me was making noise that made me want to run-come. The bathroom was not clean at all- mud and dirt covered the floor and the toilet paper roll holder was broken. The walls are so thin I heard every conversation my employees were having. I had never stayed in a hotel and had no idea what I was getting myself into before booking. The hotel itself is beautiful but the people behind the front desk attitude was rude and did not provide the service I was looking for.
" 
====================
 "You think a $600 a night hotel is a good deal? Well, I stayed at the Hilton Chicago, and it was 'good'. I had a great room, and the staff was very friendly, and the hotel staff was SUPPOSED to be very friendly.The decor was lovely, and the rooms were very comfortable. I was on the 5th floor and the lobby was very peaceful. The restaurant was located in the basement, amazing! The location was perfect for shopping, and I couldn't have asked for a better hotel. The best part of the hotel, though, was the location. It was close to EVERYTHING. I wanted to go to the Super 8 Motel 6, I wanted to go to the Crystal Ballin, I wanted to be close to the Lockwood Motel, I wanted to be close to the Sears Tower. I've stayed at the Four Seasons, the Lollipops, the Four Seasons Now, I've flown in twice now, and I've stayed at the Ritz at the Peninsula, The Talbott, the Ritz now, and I've taken a longer flight. I've even taken The Talbott. This hotel is TINY. It's been awhile since I've stayed here, and I've had enough of the mediocre service from the front desk staff. They're right behind us, and we're ALMOST annoyed when we complain. I've had better service at a Hard Rock. Oh, and the Hilton Chicago overlooks Grant Park, so it's a bit of an hike to Lake Michigan. For people who were looking for some serious downtown accomodations, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. I've had better stays at a HoJo, Sheraton, Sheraton, Sheraton... none of which are remotely close to this hotel. If you're one of the lucky people, there are plenty of other hotels in Chicago with much better reviews, but unless you're looking to spend a few bucks on a hotel room, here you're better off just getting out of bed.
" 
====================
 "I had a reservation and got a room on buckwheat, but they charge for transferring to another room type which is what you got on the website. I had to transfer to the renovation...that was pain. You can't charge someone to do something you don't need, even if that person are not happy with the arrangement. The renovation took a long time and involved putting some equipment (staff, room service) in the room and then finally the night manager put us in a different room that took off, again again taking off. Again putting equipment in the room takes away some of the pleasantries. Again, again and again. Finally, they put me into another room which was different than the one in the previous room. The carpet was still crawling with flies, the bed was still horribly uncomfortable. I was on the 6th floor and the elevator was slow. I was trying to get as many as I could into one room and when the elevator stopped there were several other tenants waiting in the lobby. I had a bag over there as well. Incredibly, it took them 30 minutes to get me in a new room. When I went into the new room, I found the air conditioner to be working again but it was so noisy that it made my sleep lapses. I became more and more irritable and had trouble walking, which was bothersome, as well. I moved into the Deluxe Suite. It had a great view of the city, lake, and lake shoreline. Despite being a King Deluxe Suite, they had difficulty reaching the lobby, only reaching by holding the door down. The room was luxurious with modern decor, but the traditional furniture and bedding, although they complained about the noise from the pool, were much less spectacular. The bed, although not terribly comfortable, was not terribly comfortable with all the modern furniture. The decor in the bathroom was attractive, however, modern toiletries were not our style in and of course, uncomfortable. The decor in the meeting rooms was not what we had imagined. The walls were thin, and the furniture was rather thin. We did not enjoy the location of the hotel. It is walking distance to all the restaurants in the city, and not to mention, not very Starbucks. We will not stay there again.

====================
 "My son & I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming. When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum. I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool, one white phone and one emergency red phone, to call the desk. Both were out of service!!!! I am am glad there wasn't an emergency. As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean.... never heard back. One more thing, in our room the furniture was mostly child friendly except for a large metal and glass outdated coffee table. Within 30 minutes my 8 year old fell and hit her mouth and began bleeding. They need to update this piece of furniture.

 "I recently stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers and was extremely disappointed. The Hotel is very old looking and a little outdated, however they make up for it by providing a fine staff with fabulous accommodations and services! The pictures on the website show a very modern room with a few of the best fixtures and a very friendly service. My wife was really annoyed by this and complained to the front desk, which is done on a case-by-case basis, but it seems to be addressed to some extent. The furnishings on the room sheathing in wood and the polished glass doors were very welcoming and the views from the rooms were very inviting. I really enjoyed the Serenity Inn and if I had to pick one to compare with this one would be the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park, Lake Michigan, Milstein, the Potter's, the Talbott or the Hilton Chicago. Location Highly Recommended Location Scorers Internet, dinner there, kids at the hotel Four Points, great location, neighbors are great, service superb, room is more than adequate, breakfast service at 312-325, room is more than adequate, the bathrooms are pretty nice, restful drinks and very high speed internet were assigned to me was very welcome. in the future, I would return to this hotel Location Scorersa metropolises to much of anything Location My use of the Internet was a dream come true Location My use of the InterContinentalATransit

 "My husband, teenage son and myself stayed at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago recently for a ball in Chicago. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were immediately greeted by a friendly face. He checked us in as soon as we showed up. He brought us a refrigerator and IPOD dock, which I brought to the hotel as an extra. He brought us a coffee maker and an hour-glass coffee filter, which I brought to the hotel as an extra. He checked us in as we told him the pros and cons of the hotel, and as we are millennials, we were surprised at how friendly and friendly they were. We shared a room and a couple of hours later, we were moved to a different room, only this time with the help of a lady (!) we didn't know. We shared a room and a half hours of customer service as we packed our bags, which was a bummer because I love to travel, but the customer service was there. The lady at the front desk treated me to a nice dinner and handed me a slip with a few bonuses! I got a great discount at the hotel! The night before we were given another room, this time for $89.95. This was a convenient location, but it was so crowded that we missed the group and were forced to split the difference with the others. I will never ever stay here again, and I'm sure they should have done something about the noise at the Hotel Allegro.

====================
 "I recently stayed here at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago, Il. As a Royal Ambassador Member of the hotel I was appalled to see that my aunts and uncles did not have the same wonderful experience as me. As we walked into the lobby, it felt as though generations past you have been forced to work for a corporation to use your home for your business. With only a few taps on the AC unit to allow the hot water to cool, I felt as if I was taking a shower in the basement. The AC unit did work, but so did the AC unit, so nice keep that in mind. We switched to a different unit which had a slightly different function. In the meantime, I had to fork over $10 for a few hours for an of my cousins, so that I could shower and fish while they were away. And the pool was $30 a night disgusting and you couldn't even get the shower tub in the house. The rooms were small and cramped, and the bathroom was old and dated. I also had to endure the fact that my aunts and uncle were not at home, so we had to pack up our things and leave. I know that it isicago, but I would not recommend this sort of accommodations for a Royal Ambassador Guest.

====================
 "My husband and I stayed here at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago a few months back. I'd heard good things about it and was very impressed. Upon our arrival, our room was barely used and looked like a scene out of Europe. There was very little decoration apart from the basic carpet had been replaced with something totally different, and the bathroom was incredibly utilitarian. The only redeeming quality of the room was that it had all been cleaned when we arrived, however, this was only through the use of an industrial process. No microfracking or anything like that. I've been to Europe where anything can happen, so the amount of noise that could be created by the noise in that area is miniscule. We were seriously considering leaving, but were turned down by the front desk. Seriously? Are you kidding? WEARING. I mean WEARING. We had conversations with some of the staff about how they weren't going to let us use their facilities, and we could hear everything in the hallways. We called down to the front desk, and they told us that they were closed for construction, and we could not safely use the facilities. We weren't going to stay at that house for the rest of our trip, but I figured we might as well make the decision to stay somewhere else. I should have known when the woman at the front desk rolled her eyes when I asked for a permit to an outdoor workout facility. This was obviously not permitted under Michigan law, and even more importantly, it was at the cost of unacceptable privacy. I should have known from the way the room was handled that I was going to be paranoid. One last thing, before we headed out, is the odor. I am a fairly light sleeper and it seemed as if the sheets had been recently smoked in. What a! this hotel has horrible decor and gross hallways. We checked out the windows only to find that the smoke screen had completely smoked out. Luckily, this was not the case for us. The door to the bathroom was already cracked and the shower door was useless. Next time, we will happily leave the room and try a much better hotel for privacy.

====================
 "We had reservations to check into the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel but had to reserve through their website. We ended up having to call the hotel directly and had our reservations delayed for several days. Once we finally got to our room, we thought, 'This could use a little help'. Our bed was not the most comfortable and there was hair in the corners where I found my back pain. We ordered some munchies from the kitchen and after that the chicken and the eggs were forgotten forgotten to cooked. On top of that, the room seemed to be cleaned so much that it was hard to hear the conversations of the tenants. I am not one to complain, mine was just really annoying. I really wanted to like the Millennium Knickerbocker but I was really disapointed. Do yourself a favor, if you plan to visit Chicago and are looking for a relaxing hotel in the Chicago winter it is probably not a bad choice. especially if you are looking for a deal like this one.

====================
 "I just returned from a trip to Chicago and stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park. I normally stay at the Four Seasons but thought I'd like a weekend away from the people and places so I decided to stay here. I was not disappointed. The check in was smooth and the hotel is nicely decorated. Most importantly though, I got a good night's sleeep because the furiture is standard and the beds are comfy. I'll definitely be staying here next time I'm in Chicago.
" 
====================
 "We booked the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park for a last minute vacation to visit my son. We were disappointed with the hotel and its service. The front desk clerks were rude and unhelpful. The room service was lackluster and the food was cold. We stayed in the King Deluxe room and it was the worst room we have ever had in a hotel. The linens were very dirty and the bathroom sink was dingy. We came here 2 times between November 2011 and March 2012 but have never had any issues with this about average. The bedding was filthy and not clean. We were ordered to leave our red headed water bottle alone at the reservation desk and it was shown to be sterile and uninviting. I know this is Chicago but I love Water Tower hotels so I made sure I saw the special rate that came with the vacation package that I did not enjoy the experience.
" 
====================
 "This hotel is totally overrated. Yes, the location is awesome, but there are plenty of other nearby hotel options. The customer service, or lack thereof, was particularly disappointing. Why are they paying anywhere from 2 - 8 doormen yet none of them can ever actually open the door for a lady? Even when her hands are full. The housekeeping staff couldn't figure out our preferences even after we left them a daily note explicitly stating such along with a tip -every day. Why ask what newspaper we want with our morning room service when you don't bring it anyway. As stated previously, the location is great. Location, however, does not make up for the complete lack of customer service and inattentiveness from staff. I would not stay here again.
" 
====================
 "I booked this hotel for $99 per night for a weekend getaway. I was shocked at the price point - this was far from a 'wow hotel'. The valet parking was not outside when we checked in so I assumed there would be some roach problem - but roach was out! The front desk was out of it all - so I grudgingly gave it a try. The location was good as well. The view was great. The front desk was close by so I could see the city well. The room was comfortable. Not huge but not horrible. It was a little small but not bad. The main thing was the bathroom. It was ok. The sink was dingy and probably from cleaning, not a watery well (I'm used to using public toilet facilities), and obviously older water types. It also had a horribly dirty key chain. And there was a major problem with the light fixture in the bathroom door. It was tiny and difficult to use. The bathroom is cramped. The shower is tiny and probably from using less materials. It also has 2 TVs stand in a very awkward spot - you can't fit into the bathroom and work with the furniture is terrible. Also the bed is surprising - very comfortable and may have contained a drowsy sleep. I might have also been a little worried about the bathrobe - it might have had a somewhat bad odor. But I was already worried about the decor. It may have been because I was so used to small - cramped spaces. This may have been a little over the top. My typical: *fridge is really *screw you *use of the bathroom - covers up sink pain by the last bathroom you walk in *use of trackpads by the tub *fridge is still being renovated - newer, better or both depending on your perspective - some have been renovated - not this 'new' generation My typical: *new wave of hotel guests coming in *new hotel decor - not friendly or welcoming *negative reviews from other guests or others On The Doorman's staff that acted like it was another room only to find out the same person had not checked in. This was just plain rude from the moment I walked in. Someone must have been in the room every now and then with their phones off and off again. Lots of people came in only to find out the door did not close. Someone was literally looking at their phone records all night. This was just plain rude. Someone tried to start the phone system in my room and over the phone for some very basic basic things like coffee and towels. I didn't know how to start things and they started to use a younger crowd. I didn't know how to set up the tv etc... Just plain rude. Stay away from this place.
" 
====================
 "The hotel is quite lovely, their spa services quite relaxing and effective. I found the rooms very comfortable, and pleasantly clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and seemed happy to help me out if need be. The hotel restaurant was quite tasty, and the food was very tasty. This hotel could not compete with the Hyatt properties, I would certainly stay there again future plans to stay at a Hilton. 
" 
====================
 "Elegant lobby, but outdated and worn out looking is the main reason I picked this hotel. The unfortunate location caused me to stay here more than once, and it was unpleasant but I paid the price.
" 
====================
 "While this hotel may be elegantly located in a lovely location, the whole of our visit was very somber and somber and we felt like we were the only guests left. The staff was very friendly and very helpful, and the rooms were very spacious and clean. The lighting in our room was amazing and we were able to get out of the room that much better at night! Our room was so quiet, we could hear the people in the next room through our window. It was very relaxing even though we were in a city hotel. We ate at the hotel restaurant for breakfast, and the food was superior to and better suited to the hotel. The hotel is in a great location in Chicago. We ate in the lobby twice, and the service was great. The hotel is also convenient to Navy Pier and a great workout area. If we are ever in the area again, we will definitely visit this hotel. 
" 
====================
 "I have stayed at several hotels in Chicago, and this is probably one of the worst. When I arrived, check in was complete and my room was ready. A lady at the front desk asked me if I would be interested in staying the night so I agreed. The next day went by and by day by the time I got to my room, the tv kept speaking its still on, it was the loudest I've ever heard. Outside the room I heard everything moving and all kinds of noise coming from the above said room. I called the front desk and asked if I could change rooms. They said they would take care of the plumbing, but that they could not give me exact time because the building is in a really bad location. Then I came back to the room and it was still loud. They did give me a wired line in the room, but that was no help for me. I went back downstairs and talked with the in/out windows. They told me it would take an hour, but if I didn't hurry, they wouldn't close the doors. I didn't want to leave. I then went to the pool, but again, it wasn't really a pool. I tried to relax by moving by the side of the pool and some of the other nearby areas. I finally got a bit of sleep and checked out. While I was there I had a look at their insurance and just assumed that for a heating issue they would not insure me on this issue. As it was not an issue that I was worried about, I decided that in order to pay compensation for our inconvenience, they should have some sort of system in place so that we could actually get a heating expense waiver. I found this hotel to be highly unprofessional. I think the best compliment I can give is to say that the two of us are ones stupid better to act than to act; one IKNOPIA, the other reactive element of the same mentalityiat vice.

====================
 "We booked this hotel for a weekend stay in Chicago, and got a 4 out of 5. We've stayed in quite a few higher end hotels in the downtown area, and the Rock bottom hotel is for that. It is a combination of those two camps, but it is definitely somewhere high. The location is superb, with its own private dining area and a indoor pool. The hotel restaurant is a very nice hold-over from when I was younger, and it includes a membership to the club, a bottle of champagne (something I really like), and the privilege of getting a complimentary room service dinner. All these things will significantly affect your decision, and you can be a very special person at the hotel. --David Michael

 "I stay at the Hilton on a week-long business trip. I usually stay with the Intercontinental Hotel. BUT, my visit to the Hilton today -- today -- came on the phone. A phone call to the Hilton -- not a voicemail -- not a fax -- not even email. I got a standard guest room with a breathtaking view of the Atlantic City. I immediately called for a tip, and was immediately told that I had to wait. A hotel-keeping person came on-line a bit later than I would have been prepared for this, but was already typing away. I got a rate, and an envelope was delivered -- within 30 feet of my room! I had to look at it to get a comment from the hotel. Not a good experience, then! My room was fine for a week, and was described as luxurious and charming. It had the largest bathroom I've ever seen, and very comfortable beds. The bed -- which was made from high-quality, not-so-sour, bedding -- was extraordinarily comfortable. I got on the hot tub, and when I reached the shower, immediately the water pressure was raised to match the bath, and the showerhead was filled with water that sounded like a military-grade hypothermic chamber. When I called for a wake up call, I was told I'd have to wait. I was expecting a 7-minute wait. I was also told that there was a check for liens on the room, which I didn't bother to confirm, because I was too busy working. I was finally given a wake up call, and when I called for a second notice, I was told the check would be at 1pm. I was extremely disappointed, truly mad and very unsatisfied with my stay. Mad people want to hear from you about your stay.

====================
 "My young son & I stayed here for a weekend in Chicago visiting with our teenage daughters. The Hotel advertised itself as a 'luxury boutique hotel' and it truly was a fake. The room we stayed in had a huge closet which contained their own personal fragrance. When we went to check out after our stay, we discovered that the closet contained a large bottle of champagne which had been left in the room the night before. While the room was certainly stylish, the sheets and towels were not the most luxurious or luxurious. The bedroom window was closed, the bathroom window was gouged & the bathroom window was dirty. The nightstand & lamp were both dirty. The carpet was very clean. The bed was uncomfortable & there was very little 'controlling power' over the amount of water that was laid over us. We were in such a hurry in our search, that we spent a large amount of time in the room next to the hotel. It was very hard to feel like we were being watched & cared for. We were awakened by people constantly using the bathroom, all while looking in our window. The rooms throughout were large & luxurious, the people in the rooms were polite, helpful, and the staff wasnt pretentious. If you are traveling for business or pleasure, stay here. The location of this hotel is ideal for getting all of downtown done quickly in a timely manner. If you are just exploring the area, stay here. If you want to revisit some old times, stay here. If you want to revisit the feeling that came from being in this hotel, stay here. If you want to revisit the old times are yours. If you want to revisit the views of downtown Chicago, stay here. If you want to revisit the nostalgia of staying in a converted elevator, stay here. If you want to revisit the wonderful restaurant ' Wicked,' stay here. If you want to revisit the beautiful hotel bar, stay here. If you want to revisit the beautiful room, decor and experience of an old age, stay here. If you want to revisit the beautiful evening cheesesteak, stay here. If you want to revisit the beautiful evening with a view, at the very least, of grabbing a drink at the bar.

====================
 "negative reviews for this hotel. I understand that. But I'm also a huge fan of Kimpton hotels. The Kimptons are a two chain hotel. With the Hyatt Regency Hotel, you get everything you'd expect from a four star hotel. The rooms are spacious, with their own valet service,and valet parking is free. The hotel has a great food menu, and very nice wine and beer selections. In fact, I would say my favorite restaurant of them all. My suite was extremely clean and well appointed, and it had a very comfortary feel to it. The bottom line is that you can't go wrong with this hotel. If you're looking for a luxurious, high quality hotel in a downtown Chicago area, you should stay here. I've stayed in great cities as diverse as Chicago this year along with so many, I would not pick this one. I've even looked elsewhere for my wedding or even just a stay at home. My wife and I just love Chicago. We are very much looking forward to our next destination. NOT FOR BUSINESSES, however!
" 
====================
 "The hotel is very nice. The lobby is beautiful. The room is a little small but it is very comfortable. The best part of the hotel is the location. It's walking distance to Michigan Ave and the river. The morning I was there for a morning swim, my room was stuffed full of college kids! I bumped into one of them and I was mad because Icalledoutout for me to get help. The concierge called me awhirl and helped me straighten out of my rambunctious days. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago.
" 
====================
 "We booked an Adventure Time Suite for 4 nights in July. We could not have found the front desk clerk more than once telling us that 'this is your room'. That is the only thing that is visible from the street. The hotel is very dated. The decor is very dark and outdated. The indoor pool is not available as many have stated. The service which we received was lacking. The tub is watery and the toilet paper roll was cracked. The room was very small and dirty. We miss the pool. The hotel is about 10 mins from the subway and the front door is on the back of the door not a bell. We stayed in the 37 room hotel that is not on the website. We called the hotel on r/treatingempire ,and they said they will honor our request for a 37 room. We were very upset about this since they did not charge forysubscenium bottles. We asked for a refund and the hotel said they will look into it but never did give us that kind of information. We are frequent visitors toChicago and have never had this problem in any other hotel I have stayed at. I called the hotel and spoke with one of the staff about the issue and they said the other staff had it wrong. It was very dark when we arrived at night and the street was dark. We were not allowed to change rooms because the street was so dark. We were on the 11th floor and the lights didn't go on all night. When we got to our room, we were literally floating above a portrait painting room. It was dark and that made me very uncomfortable. The street and portrait were not what we expected and for them to be outside inviting was against the grain. Since we were on a budget we did not want to be in such a dark room. The mattress and bath mat were rather heavy. We were also paying about 130 a night. They should be making sure thatt all people gets a fair chance to sleep there.
" 
====================
 "I was very disappointed with this hotel. The front desk clerk was rude and unprofessional and if I did not express this opinion I could be charged for the room. The front desk clerk was rude and unprofessional and I did not expect it to be this bad. The room was smaller than I expected. It was in the middle of the busiest time of the week and it was dirty and worn in the corners. I did not understand the desk clerk's decision not to charge me for the room. It appeared to me that they were trying to cover up the malfunctioning duvet cover, but it didn't quite make up for the fact that my bathroom tub was covered with dirt and I found numerous small bits of siding and white lead solder. In addition, the carpet on the bathroom was stained with some sort of chocolate sauce. I was extremely disappointed with the room and its services.
" 
====================
 "The hotel is rather stupid to be frank. The room is not huge either. The room has not been cleaned and the beds are not all the same sheets. The food in the restaurant is terrible and not what you would expect from a Conservative hotel. There is no tea in the morning or in the morning bar service. Also, the rooms are small and the bathroom is like a military therapy suite. I have stayed in many hotels where the prices were ridiculous and the compensation was nothing compared to staying in this hotel. We would never stay here again.
" 
====================
 "I'd been searching for a cool, non-chain hotel for a weekend getaway and found this one. I'm a highly-at-allergic, and I've had some pretty unpleasant experiences from previous reservationeers (non-Chevy) - especially those who booked through Hotwire, whom they thought had a stellar track record of customer service. Upon arrival, the doormen started implying that I was crazy-cap and started making snide remarks about my natural hair, or at the very least, long hairs, as if I was the only person in the room without a hat. I was treated rudely and with no respect. I left the flat and went somewhere else.
" 
====================
 "I am staying here now and first let me say amazing. The staff is wonderful and the room very very nice. The bathroom was small. Also the bed was like a bathroom painting. Not what you would expect from a top of the line hotel.Next to the hotel I also found some fresh fruit and yogurt. The only thing I liked was the water pressure was very low.Also the walls were so paper thin. I had a really bad case of hot lava flowing from my toiletries. It made you lose your bearings and it made you lose your bearings.The room was also very small. Not what you would expect from a top of the line hotel but it was typical of many this year.I give it a two and a half, but I would recomend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice place to stay.
" 
====================
 "this hotel was a nightmare from the get go. i was in a hurry through Arizona and this hotel made it very difficult to get there. the room itself was not out of this world but it was thin and the walls are so thin. I was sweating so bad after nights strolling through their sterile corridors. matthew bell and joseph benior/tinsel staff were unbelievably rude from the get go. they made fun of us for being young and poor. they even mocked us for being so patient. how rude! we didn't even want to leave the hotel becuase they were certain that we were the ones they needed.
" 
====================
 "I was very unsatisfied with my stay at the Affinia Hotel in Chicago. Although the location was good, the rooms sucked. The sheets smelled of smoke, the bathroom did not work, the TV reception was very poor, and the cleaning was never efficient. I would not stay there again.
" 
====================
 "My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming. When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum. I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool, one white phone and one emergency red phone, to call the desk. Both were out of service!!!! I am glad there wasn't an emergency. As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean.... never heard back. One more thing, in our room the furniture was mostly used, and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a while. I also had a television set that no longer was there, but was lying on the bed. I called the desk and asked for it to be moved, it was still attached to the bed, not fixed. Another occurence of the room was a hot stove in the corner. It would have been nice to be able to move it about 9/20 times per night. I called the concierge and said there were no other available hotels left, we would book one right away for our kids. When we arrived at the hotel, it was December 31st, 2009. We had 2 suitesites available at one palace. One was clean and online, the other was dead busy. This was very disappointing, once again showing that you have to cram too many people into one hotel. We stayed in the Continental Shandya and it was the worst hotel ever. The heating in our room was so noisy we almost gave it a second thought. The room was huge, felt like we were in a huge construction site, there was mold everywhere and the curtains were scuffed up. The bathroom was filthy and looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in a month. We came here several times and never had this happen. The bathroom has gravestones, these days there is no gravestone service, but because our room hadn't been cleaned, we asked for it to be sent for a gravestone service. It was, but the service did little to make our stay any better. The service did bring us cheap wine and beer, which were sorely lacking in our last stay. We didn't bother going down to the lobby to check out the website and video of the actual event, we got lukewarm recommendations from the doorman. If it had not been for the helpful internet searching help there would have been a good steak in the lobby, but we weren't even allowed to inspect it. This hotel is too good to be true and we will never stay at this place again.
" 
====================
 "The Hotel Allegro has some of the best decor I have ever seen in a hotel. The food is amazing, especially the ones served, The Allegro is tucked away in a good location. It is a no brainer showered with people who thought they were going to steal it for brunch. The hotel is well placed the rooms are very cozy and very clean. I would recommend this hotel to any one who is in or saw the area.
" 
====================
 "My son & I were having a 3 day anniversary weekend get married at The Palm in NYC. We had a room overlooking the concert city. We had the largest bathroom we have in a suite. The room was very clean and the beds were extremely comfortable. We had no issues with germs, although they did get our clothes pameled and some of the pajamas sewn onto the walls. The hotel is in a great location in Manhattan, close to the Chicago River, and so close to walking. We did stop for a drink at the Lockwood Restaurant which was a nice place for us to cut a hotel short. Our room was very nice with a great king size bed and great room for our luggage as we split our time in the room. The hotel is in walking distance to the museums and also close to shopping and day trips to other locations. We would definitely stay here again & would recommend it to others. 
" 
====================
 "I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago for one night last month and I was very disappointed with it. When I arrived there was no line at all. And it was annoying since I was able to check in in the morning but then again I'm a CIO so experience can be different! The rooms are average at best (one of the best parts) but when I cooled my dog it was filthy clean and there was a mess on my bed. I wanted to send it to a nelly on the desk but they told me that there was no record of it and that there was no chance for me to get rid of it. My final verdict is you can't go wrong with this hotel and if you do, don't stay here. I think it's a big disappointment but if you like it, don't take another one.
" 
====================
 "The hotel was very busy and despite being within walking distance to many sights and the fact that it is close to several attractions the hotel did not bother to show us the rooms. It seems that the focus of the money spent on this hotel was on the interior design of the room instead of the actual welcoming and settling of the guests. The furniture and paintings were unremarkable and the hotel guests seemed more interested in the sofa top and coffee table tops. Despite having paid for the InterContinental package, I still was not comfortable with the price. I recently had to spend an hour in the room for a one night stay. I did not sit down for a drink as I was booked for an overnight stay. I decided to check in late rather than take a taxi to the airport because the hotel was so busy. For my part in the hotel was very clean and the staff was very friendly. I did not partake of the (free) morning beverages at the bar but when I requested a cup of coffee I was politely told that it was not a free drink. The InterContinental has a lot of restrictions and I was pleased to know that they thought I would be accommodating. 
" 
====================
 "Wow! I have been meaning to write a review of my stay at the Omni but was really, really tired! For the price, the staff was very unhelpful and unhelpful. The room was seemingly nicer than I expected, but the attitude and behavior of the staff was from an inexperienced, inexperienced girl. And I would not recommend this hotel to anyone under thirty!
" 
====================
 "A really lovely room, but I would NOT recommend it to anyone. It is dated and worn, with only the faintest resemblance to the one pictured. I would say that from the moment you get this hotel you will be totally impressed. There is a woman that works there and she has a very unfriendly attitude. You are stepping away from a people and you are greeted with disdain and she is not even remotely dressed to try to help you. The day care facility is beautiful and the beds are better then you think at $500 a night there is nothing better than that. You will be amazed at the amount of time you spend working at this place. You will also be disapointed at the cleanliness of the room and the total lack of hygiene in the whole hotel. I have stayed at about a dozen different hotels in Chicago and none have ever disappointed. If I were to give a one chance run across the city I would definitely try this hotel again, but it is far from the worst place to stay.
